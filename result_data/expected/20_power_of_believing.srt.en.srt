00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,440
Today I want to tell you three stories

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,080
from my life. That's it. No big deal,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
just three stories.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
[Music]

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,200
The first story is about connecting the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
dots.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
I dropped out of Reed College after the

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,439
first 6 months, but then stayed around

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
as a dropin for another 18 months or so

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,640
before I really quit.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,599
So why' I drop out?

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,559
It started before I was born.

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,640
My biological mother was a young unwed

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,719
graduate student and she decided to put

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
me up for adoption.

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800
She felt very strongly that I should be

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
adopted by college graduates. So

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,640
everything was all set for me to be

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
adopted at birth by a lawyer and his

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
wife.

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
Except that when I popped out, they

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,160
decided at the last minute that they

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,000
really wanted a girl.

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
So, my parents, who were on a waiting

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,879
list, got a call in the middle of the

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,559
night asking, "We've got an unexpected

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,199
baby boy. Do you want him?" They said,

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,439
"Of course."

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,360
My biological mother found out later

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
that my mother had never graduated from

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,240
college and that my father had never

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,680
graduated from high school. She refused

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,520
to sign the final adoption papers.

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
She only relented a few months later

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,600
when my parents promised that I would go

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
to college. This was the start in my

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,840
life.

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,079
And 17 years later, I did go to college.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,799
But I naively chose a college that was

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,720
almost as expensive as Stanford.

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
And all of my workingclass parents

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,759
savings were being spent on my college

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,240
tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,479
the value in it. I had no idea what I

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
wanted to do with my life and no idea

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
how college was going to help me figure

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
it out. And here I was spending all the

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,799
money my parents had saved their entire

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,439
life.

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,240
So I decided to drop out and trust that

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,000
it would all work out okay. It was

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,079
pretty scary at the time, but looking

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
back, it was one of the best decisions I

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,959
ever made.

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,959
The minute I dropped out, I could stop

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
taking the required classes that didn't

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,040
interest me and begin dropping in on the

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,440
ones that looked far more interesting.

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,080
dorm room, so I slept on the floor and

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,080
friends rooms. I returned Coke bottles

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
for the 5-cent deposits to buy food

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,040
with, and I would walk the seven miles

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,120
across town every Sunday night to get

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,879
one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,360
Temple. I loved it. And much of what I

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
stumbled into by following my curiosity

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,519
and intuition turned out to be priceless

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,440
later on. Let me give you one example.

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
Reed College at that time offered

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,239
perhaps the best calligraphy instruction

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
in the country. Throughout the campus,

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,920
every poster, every label on every

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,599
drawer was beautifully

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
handcalliggraphed.

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
Because I had dropped out and didn't

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
have to take the normal classes, I

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,159
decided to take a calligraphy class to

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,879
learn how to do this. I learned about

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
serif and sans serif type faces, about

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,400
varying the amount of space between

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,680
different letter combinations, about

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,159
what makes great typography great.

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
It was beautiful, historical,

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,640
artistically subtle in a way that

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
science can't capture. And I found it

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
fascinating.

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
None of this had even a hope of any

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,760
practical application in my life.

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,000
But 10 years later when we were

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,560
designing the first Macintosh computer,

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,040
it all came back to me and we designed

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,000
it all into the Mac. It was the first

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,840
computer with beautiful typography. If I

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
had never dropped in on that single

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,599
course in college, the Mac would have

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
never had multiple type faces or

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,319
proportionally spaced fonts. And since

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
that no personal computer would have

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
them.

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,280
If I had never dropped out, I would have

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
never dropped in on that calligraphy

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
class, and personal computers might not

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,760
have the wonderful typography that they

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,519
do. Of course, it was impossible to

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,840
connect the dots looking forward when I

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,879
was in college, but it was very, very

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,959
clear looking backwards 10 years later.

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,720
Again, you can't connect the dots

111
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,280
looking forward. You can only connect

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
them looking backwards. So, you have to

113
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,360
trust that the dots will somehow connect

114
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
in your future. You have to trust in

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
something. Your gut, destiny, life,

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
karma, whatever. Because believing that

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
the dots will connect down the road will

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
give you the confidence to follow your

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,440
heart even when it leads you off the

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,990
well-worn path. And that will make all

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
the difference.

122
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,120
[Music]

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:52,080
My second story is about love and loss.

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,880
I was lucky. I found what I love to do

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,280
early in life. W and I started Apple in

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,440
my parents' garage when I was 20. We

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
worked hard and in 10 years, Apple had

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
grown from just the two of us in a

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,759
garage into a two billion dollar company

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
with over 4,000 employees. We just

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
released our finest creation, the

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Macintosh, a year earlier, and I just

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,160
turned 30.

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
And then I got fired.

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
How can you get fired from a company you

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
started?

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
who I thought was very talented to run

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,479
the company with me. And for the first

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
year or so, things went well. But then

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,759
our visions of the future began to

142
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,320
diverge. And eventually, we had a

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,120
falling out. When we did, our board of

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,560
directors sided with him. And so, at 30,

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,320
I was out and very publicly out. What

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,520
had been the focus of my entire adult

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,039
life was gone. And it was devastating.

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,360
I really didn't know what to do for a

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
few months. I felt that I had let the

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
previous generation of entrepreneurs

151
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,160
down, that I had dropped the baton as it

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
was being passed to me. I met with David

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Packard and Bob and tried to apologize

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,919
for screwing up so badly. I was a very

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
public failure and I even thought about

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,039
running away from the valley. But

157
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,000
something slowly began to dawn on me. I

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,680
still loved what I did.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
The turn of events at Apple had not

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,600
changed that one bit. I'd been rejected,

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,919
but I was still in love. And so, I

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,080
decided to start over.

163
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
I didn't see it then, but it turned out

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
that getting fired from Apple was the

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
best thing that could have ever happened

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
to me. The heaviness of being successful

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
was replaced by the lightness of being a

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
beginner again, less sure about

169
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
everything. It freed me to enter one of

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
the most creative periods of my life.

171
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
During the next 5 years, I started a

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
company named Next, another company

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,720
named Pixar, and fell in love with an

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
amazing woman who would become my wife.

175
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
Pixar went on to create the world's

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
first computer animated feature film,

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,319
Toy Story, and is now the most

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,880
successful animation studio in the

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,759
world.

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,400
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,240
bought Next and I returned to Apple. And

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,520
the technology we developed at Next is

183
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,479
at the heart of Apple's current

184
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,960
renaissance. and Loren and I have a

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,880
wonderful family together.

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm pretty sure none of this would have

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
happened if I hadn't been fired from

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Apple. It was awful tasting medicine,

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,520
but I guess the patient needed it.

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,680
Sometime life Sometimes life's going to

191
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,319
hit you in the head with a brick. Don't

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
lose faith. I'm convinced that the only

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
thing that kept me going was that I

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,639
loved what I did. You've got to find

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,599
what you love. And that is as true for

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,120
work as it is for your lovers. Your work

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
is going to fill a large part of your

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
life. And the only way to be truly

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,520
satisfied is to do what you believe is

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,560
great work. And the only way to do great

201
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,120
work is to love what you do. If you

202
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,000
haven't found it yet, keep looking and

203
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
don't settle. As with all matters of the

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
heart, you'll know when you find it. And

205
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,479
like any great relationship, it just

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,120
gets better and better as the years roll

207
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,120
on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

208
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,960
My third story is about death.

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,759
When I was 17, I read a quote that went

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,000
something like, "If you live each day as

211
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,479
if it was your last, someday you'll most

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
certainly be right."

213
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
It made an impression on me. And since

214
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
then, for the past 33 years, I've looked

215
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
in the mirror every morning and asked

216
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,160
myself, if today were the last day of my

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,039
life, would I want to do what I am about

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,680
to do today? And whenever the answer has

219
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,240
been no for too many days in a row, I

220
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
know I need to change something.

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,159
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is

222
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,680
the most important tool I've ever

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
encountered to help me make the big

224
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,279
choices in life. Because almost

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,680
everything, all external expectations,

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,240
all pride, all fear of embarrassment or

227
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,800
failure, these things just fall away in

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
the face of death, leaving only what is

229
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,000
truly important. Remembering that you

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,160
are going to die is the best way I know

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,640
to avoid the trap of thinking you have

232
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,440
something to lose. You are already

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,000
naked. There is no reason not to follow

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,200
your heart.

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,040
No one wants to die. Even people who

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,399
want to go to heaven don't want to die

237
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,959
to get there. And yet death is the

238
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
destination we all share. No one has

239
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,399
ever escaped it. And that is as it

240
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,600
should be because death is very likely

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,760
the single best invention of life. It's

242
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
life's change agent. It clears out the

243
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,000
old to make way for the new. Right now,

244
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
the new is you. But someday, not too

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,279
long from now, you will gradually become

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,800
the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be

247
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,680
so dramatic, but it's quite true.

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Your time is limited, so don't waste it

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,720
living someone else's life. Don't be

250
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
trapped by dogma, which is living with

251
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,279
the results of other people's thinking.

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,080
Don't let the noise of others opinions

253
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,000
drown out your own inner voice. And most

254
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,560
important, have the courage to follow

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,880
your heart and intuition. They somehow

256
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,079
already know what you truly want to

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:18,839
become. Everything else is secondary.

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,839
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
