1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
welcome everyone it's my uh pleasure to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,080
uh welcome all of you to uh Professor

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,240
David Patterson's talk uh David

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,160
Patterson probably needs no introduction

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,120
uh he's been a professor of computer

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,520
science at uh University of California

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,480
Berkeley for 40 years now and uh he's

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,960
made a lot of pioneering contributions

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,439
in computer systems a lot of which are

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,920
Technologies we use at Google and

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,119
elsewhere so risk uh reduce instruction

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,560
at computers uh raid network of

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,160
workstations and a lot more uh he has a

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,840
pretty long bio here I didn't realize he

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,200
has won 35 Awards and all of them are

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,559
pretty prestigious uh National Academy

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,360
of engineering National Academy of

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,879
Sciences Silicon Valley Engineering all

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,719
of Fame I E1 nman medal and I'm sure I'm

20
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,199
offending some significant award by not

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,800
saying that but uh he's had a very

22
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,640
distinguished career and this talk today

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,960
uh in his own words uh collects advice

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,960
that I wish I had been given when I

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,600
started my career and given how

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,399
distinguished that's been uh I think

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,079
it's a talk we are all going to uh

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,200
benefit from so welcome well uh this is

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,439
a what happened is I uh decided uh uh

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,640
somebody wrote me these slides about how

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,320
to have a bad career been out there for

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,320
a long time and they asked me if there

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,280
was a video of it and I couldn't find

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,000
one uh I actually figured out that I

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,840
gave this talk first 20 years ago but

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,400
I've given it over the years so I

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
decided to record it at Berkeley and it

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,759
ended up and I announced that my plans

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
to retire that went two days before this

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,360
so uh it it got a lot of visibility so

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
and it's fun to come here as as far as I

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,280
can tell all of my oh yeah sorry as far

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
as I can tell

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,479
on all of my former students are going

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
to end up here

46
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,960
sometime also have to ask them if

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,799
they're leaving where they are I know

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,240
where they're ending up and so it's it's

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,840
it feels like it's a home week here as I

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,799
said this is the advice I wish I would

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,560
have had uh in my uh career uh this got

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,560
started uh I got about 30 years ago uh

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,759
decided want to give advice on talk so I

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
wrote how to give a bad talk talk and

55
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,880
that was a lot of fun and about 10 years

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,159
later how to have a bad career and and

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,560
uh about a couple years ago I did how to

58
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,879
have a bad Research Center so this is my

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,920
bad

60
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,800
series uh now I'm just going to put the

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,280
uh if you're interested uh these slides

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,239
are certainly available as well as the

63
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,560
talk and there's a lot of papers and

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,480
things that you can site if you want to

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,959
read more about it and I'd like to thank

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
a bunch of people for making suggestions

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,519
that I've incorporated or their careers

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,360
inspired them one of those of those two

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,920
uh so uh the parts there's two parts to

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,680
the talk the kind of tongue and cheek

71
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,120
how to have a bad career and then how to

72
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,680
avoid a bad career and then I'll open up

73
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,640
for questions and answers and then I'll

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,440
wrap things up whenever we have to wrap

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,360
things up and take the last five or 10

76
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,000
minutes talking about my story how I got

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,239
here and what works for me so uh so you

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,120
want to be a leader of the field

79
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,280
especially if you're an Academia so how

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,519
could you do that well invent a new

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,159
field is a really good way to do that

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,680
and you want to be the only person in

83
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,959
that field so how can you invent a field

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,000
and be the only person

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,440
uh well one way is you know different

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,920
from other fields you want to be the

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
Lone Ranger and a way you can be the

88
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,720
Lone Ranger the only one is there is

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,959
your personality can help uh can help if

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
you adopt the Primadonna

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
personality and some people don't know

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,519
who what a primadonna is but if you

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,159
adopt that personality nobody will want

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,439
to work with you and you can drive

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,840
people away and then you'll be the

96
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,159
world's leading expert cuz you're the

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,080
only one in that field in terms of the

98
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,959
research Horizons for your new field you

99
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,640
want to be have a lot of flexibility on

100
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,239
success uh you know you don't want to

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,680
get too fine and uh and if you say it's

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,159
20 years out then you know you got 19

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,640
safe years right and nobody's going to

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,640
accuse you of doing engineering work if

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,439
it's 20 20 years

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,920
out and uh you know stick to that topic

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,120
for your whole career now if I'd only

108
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,560
followed that advice my dissertation was

109
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
on micro programming if I'd stuck to

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,879
this I would absolutely be the world's

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,280
expert in microprogramming partly

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,400
because no one's built a computer with

113
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,519
micro code in 25 years and you kind of

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,519
think of it like it's like fashion you

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
like skinny jeans are popular now or

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,519
they were popular 25 years ago if you

117
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,280
just kept them you could reuse your own

118
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,400
Gene so research is like that wait

119
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,720
they'll come back to

120
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,000
you okay uh let complexity be your guide

121
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
confuse thy enemies the best thing you

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,080
can say it's so complicated I can't

123
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,759
can't understand what you're talking

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,720
about and that's that that you done a

125
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,360
good

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,720
job one reason is it's easier to claim

127
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,280
credit for things if somebody else has

128
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,160
done some work you can say well that was

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,320
in my paper and since they don't

130
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,039
understand it how can they contradict

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,320
you

132
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,000
right the other thing that's surprising

133
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,880
it's really a lot easier to be

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,240
complicated you read the first end

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,840
papers and then it's you figure out the

136
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,440
next one and people publish it it's

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,039
really much harder to be simpler than to

138
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,720
be complicated so that's the easy way to

139
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,440
do it and this sentence captures it

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
right if it's UNS simple how could you

141
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
dis sish colleagues departments around

142
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,720
the world be positively appreciative and

143
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,360
so on so on that there you go that's a

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,400
way to speak and to talk never be proven

145
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,080
wrong the first thing you want to do is

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,720
don't Implement anything it's hard to

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
prove you wrong if you don't implement

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,960
it now if some out of control colleague

149
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
builds something then whatever you do

150
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,560
don't run any quantitative experiments

151
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,440
if you if they're not quantitative then

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,759
you can't be proven

153
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,199
wrong uh you've got the intuition you

154
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,600
can just kind of extrapolate with the

155
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,400
results there are put that in without

156
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
any

157
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,160
experiments and you know your job isn't

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,479
to help the critics you know that's

159
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,800
their job to figure out uh don't help

160
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,479
them out now uh another reason is that

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,280
clearly the success of the career is to

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,120
publish as much as you can and it takes

163
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,600
time to build and to uh measure so if

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
you don't do that you can get more

165
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,919
results and have a more successful

166
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
career if somebody does it the last

167
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,400
thing you want to do is run any

168
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,600
benchmarks because then they could

169
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,800
compare your results to other things the

170
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,280
uh advice of being

171
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,319
uh that uh you've got those those safe

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,560
years and the benchmarks can

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,240
just the the way you get out of that is

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,800
to say well these this computer is for

175
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,759
future uh programs not for current

176
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,360
programs and then uh these benchmarks

177
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,599
are too Antiquated to run on my computer

178
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,160
now the other thing that we do in

179
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,400
computer science is we uh reject all the

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,639
past you know we're a new field we're

181
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,120
both science and engineering so we're

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,560
not hidebound

183
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,680
by oldfashioned things like the

184
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,080
scientific method we have the computer

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,240
scientific method instead of a

186
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,319
hypothesis we have a

187
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,479
hunch a sequence of experiments we know

188
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,960
that sequential is slow so what we do we

189
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,680
change one one experiment all the

190
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,400
parameters at once that's much faster

191
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
than the sequential approach Paralis is

192
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,240
a good idea and rather than prove or

193
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,560
disprove

194
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,639
hypothesis we discard if it doesn't

195
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,319
support the hunch you know we've got

196
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,560
there's lots of data it's a big data

197
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,560
throw away the data there's still plenty

198
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,360
of data

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,680
left um and document for others

200
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
reproduce we've already done it we'll

201
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,879
have more results of the field if we

202
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,400
don't waste our time trying to reproduce

203
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,360
each other's results that's the computer

204
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,919
scientific method don't be distracted by

205
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,520
others avoid

206
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,800
feedback uh you know a big part of that

207
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,960
is conversation and if you don't say

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,039
anything people might think you're not

209
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,160
very smart so the Corel are of that is

210
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,639
loud is smart okay so be loud in

211
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,759
conversations even when you don't know

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,520
what you're talking about people will

213
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,440
think you know what you're talking

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,319
about um if you're the words leading

215
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,680
expert you don't really need to read

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,199
other things because you're the expert

217
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,800
right uh and you don't want to you don't

218
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,000
have to be interact with others because

219
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,560
they're not as good as you are in terms

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,240
of doing reviews for paper if it's

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,159
simple and obvious it insult the prior

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,400
authors if you accept something simple

223
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,759
and obvious they probably thought of it

224
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,280
so you should reject it uh if their

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,400
quantitative results and I've gotten

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
this review before well I already knew

227
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,120
that so there's no surprise to reject it

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,080
and just you know everything else you

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,919
might as well just

230
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,720
reject uh you know they're kind of

231
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,759
competitors to you in some way and if

232
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,840
they P paper doesn't get published then

233
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,240
you win so that's a good

234
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,000
guideline now publishing journals is

235
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,199
technology transfer you're the leading

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,159
person in the world you're the expert

237
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,840
all you have to do is write in the

238
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,120
journal it's not your job to make it

239
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,360
understandable to others to the ordinary

240
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,399
Engineers going to conferences just

241
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,599
wastes some of your valuable time that

242
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,120
you could be coming up with new ideas

243
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,560
and you know having to interact with uh

244
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,800
industry and things like that that's a

245
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
Time waster you write the journals

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
you're

247
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,160
done now clearly the winner is the one

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,279
with the most papers at the end of the

249
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
career so I've come up with this Pyramid

250
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,920
of Success for publication and it

251
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,200
follows the rule four and and the

252
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,640
guideline is the lpu leas poal unit the

253
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
lpu is good for you so you start off

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,040
with one idea then with rule of four you

255
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,839
get four Journal papers out of that uh

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,120
with a miracle of world processing then

257
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,920
you can get 16 extended abstracts and 64

258
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,079
technical reports from one single idea

259
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,320
that's 84 Publications I guess that and

260
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,440
then in terms of getting credit for it

261
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,720
uh my advice is to change your name to

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
the Swedish spelling of

263
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,079
Anderson and then and then and then

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,800
there's awkward time oh how are we going

265
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,680
to put the office on the table will say

266
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:37,000
well I've always done it alphabetically

267
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,120
you all my papers that all right writing

268
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,920
cams for a bad

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,079
career uh Thou shalt not Define terms

270
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,720
that's what dictionaries are before and

271
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,279
explaining things that'll just insult

272
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,959
the reader so you want to be a little

273
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,560
bit more mysterious than

274
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,360
that uh Thou shalt use replace I will

275
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,200
build with I have been built you know

276
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,880
probably by the time your paper gets

277
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,800
published in a journal somebody have

278
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,040
implemented it so it's okay to kind of

279
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,079
do

280
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,640
that V sh not mention drawbacks to your

281
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,360
report report that's not your job that's

282
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,079
the job of the critics to figure out

283
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,800
drawbacks you know if you hide that

284
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,519
they'll never notice it uh Thou shalt

285
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,040
not reference any papers again except

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,680
for maybe your own or at your

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
institution and if if the papers were

288
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,079
any good they'd be people at your

289
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,440
institution so don't you don't do that

290
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,640
and then you should publish before

291
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,320
implementing because that's when your

292
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,320
system is the fastest you know

293
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,639
okay talk Commandments for a bad career

294
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,519
this is my bad career talk uh th Shelt

295
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,600
not be neat you know why take the time

296
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,279
to spend it on your slides to you know

297
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
fix spelling errors grammatical errors

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
you've got to you could spend that time

299
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
on

300
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,600
Research Thou shalt not wite space you

301
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,440
know you use up a lot of slides that's a

302
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,360
lot of kilobytes being wasted there you

303
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,079
can save like 100 kilobytes a year which

304
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,120
saves some

305
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,600
money uh Thou shalt not covet brevity do

306
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
you really want to sustain The

307
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,639
Stereotype that Engineers can't write

308
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,040
right you want to show full

309
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,399
paragraphs uh beautiful beautiful

310
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,720
English and read it

311
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,399
aloud uh Thou shalt cover the naked

312
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,760
slides I'll show you what I mean by that

313
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,399
later but you don't want to expose the

314
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,320
whole slide to everybody and and shock

315
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,399
them uh Thou shalt not print large the

316
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,920
important people sit in the front

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:32,920
right so who cares about guys in the

318
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,279
back uh shalt not use color use of color

319
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,760
indicates uh you know uncareful research

320
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,959
you're emphasizing some words over

321
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,320
others and it's just too showy to use

322
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,320
color Thou shalt not illustrate

323
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,399
confucious says uh a picture is worth

324
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,880
10,000 words who cares about the wisdom

325
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,360
of the ages

326
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,279
right and uh Thou shalt not make eye

327
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,040
contact you want to be humble kind of

328
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,600
pretend to be humble keep your eyes down

329
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,360
and you know try not to let anybody see

330
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,040
you uh Thou shalt not skip slides long

331
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,560
talk I guarantee in this room somebody

332
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
has done looked up at their looked at

333
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,720
their watch see how many slides they

334
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,079
have then their solution is I'll just

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,440
talk faster right that's what people do

336
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,959
you prepare the slides they want to see

337
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,440
them all and if you have to just cut off

338
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,720
the conclusions the last couple of

339
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
slides if you run out of time and then

340
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,639
this is the Golden Rule this one can

341
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,600
save you if even if you violate the

342
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,839
others Thou shalt not practice how can

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,360
you be spontaneous if you practice right

344
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,440
you'll it'll feel it'll feel practiced

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,560
if you practice so don't do that that's

346
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,279
the last thing you should

347
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,959
do uh so here's an example of doing it

348
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,320
it's actually says PowerPoint but it's

349
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:44,519
it's using Google Slides so uh trying

350
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,279
these commandments so uh print small now

351
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,079
these features somebody some engineer

352
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,760
Google put these features in so you have

353
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,760
to use them to be a good Google employee

354
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,519
um so you want to hide your naked slides

355
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,560
there that's a some variety but again no

356
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,240
use of

357
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,160
color there you go that's another

358
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,760
dramatic entrance and then uh this last

359
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,000
the next one is just my favorite I'm

360
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,959
glad somebody put the time in to put

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,959
this in because it's very

362
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,959
useful there you go but

363
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:20,440
a okay so that was the bad career advice

364
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,360
let's talk about Alternatives career uh

365
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,160
this is taken from my career which span

366
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,199
40 years so it's kind of an academic I

367
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,720
hope it'll apply to here it's in systems

368
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,880
not in theory uh and I'll go through

369
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,320
these pieces uh one by one so advice to

370
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,760
writing uh bad papers uh and I again I

371
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,320
put some writing tips there the writing

372
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,720
tips actually have some grammatical

373
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,959
errors in them following my bad

374
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,680
tradition but uh you can go look take a

375
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,360
look so do the opposite of the bad paper

376
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,240
Commandments uh do Define your terms

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,079
distinguish will do from have done if

378
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,079
you're writing for critical review

379
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,399
reviewers are very skeptical people

380
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,920
they're going to assume the worst they

381
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,519
are much more impressed if you point out

382
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,120
the drawbacks rather than they have to

383
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,800
discover

384
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,680
them uh and you know you have to measure

385
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,639
performance and reference the work to be

386
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,519
a

387
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,680
scholar and the good news is you guys

388
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,399
build a wonderful service to make that

389
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,320
much easier to do these days in scholar

390
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,560
uh the great the best piece of advice I

391
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
ever got was to read Strunk and white uh

392
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,759
Strunk believed in brevity so much he

393
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,600
cherish Brey so much he couldn't write a

394
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,800
long book the book itself is maybe 80

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,680
Pages or so and it's chalk full of good

396
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,759
advice then uh you know we do this the

397
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,720
advices basically go kind of top down

398
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,480
you just write write a onepage outline

399
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,120
with a tentative uh title with budgets

400
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,199
how much you need to write a lot of

401
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,920
writing that saves a lot of writing if

402
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,399
you don't have to do it then a paragraph

403
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,399
map which is a topic sentence as it goes

404
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,920
the way through and it includes uh

405
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,680
figures and captions even today in 2016

406
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,480
it takes forever on a computer to draw a

407
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,320
figure and since you might throw that

408
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
you're probably going to throw that

409
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,560
figure right to change it the best

410
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,959
technology to do that today is go to a

411
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,639
whiteboard you even have colored pens

412
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,199
take a little self phone picture and

413
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,560
stick that in your document that'll take

414
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,279
you you know one tenth the time as

415
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,920
trying to do something on a computer

416
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,160
because you know you might throw it away

417
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,040
and then re write the

418
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,199
draft um I like the Scientific American

419
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,720
style which has really long captions not

420
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,199
everybody does that but you can move

421
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,040
text in there and associate with the

422
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,079
figure I think that works well I really

423
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
like tables a lot there's a lot of Drey

424
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,199
facts I love putting them into tables

425
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,399
that works well for

426
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,240
me uh then in terms of when you're

427
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,800
starting to polish the text read aloud

428
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,519
your ear is better than your eyes when I

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,880
start reading a document and I I forget

430
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,560
and I stop saying it out loud I I lose

431
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,319
track but if you hear the words you can

432
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,759
hear terrible sentences and grammatical

433
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,240
errors if you hear it there's technology

434
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,680
and fact I was I just learned about this

435
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,600
thing it was from an English Professor

436
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,880
who talk a massive open upline course at

437
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,160
Berkeley said why aren't you using a

438
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,199
grammar checker and she said this is the

439
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,360
world's best one Pearson writer and it

440
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,199
cost you a whole $20 a year and it will

441
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,240
prevent terrible grammatical errors and

442
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,680
even help style in fact I think I was

443
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,920
thinking I should you guys should buy

444
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,399
this it's it's one of the things you're

445
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,959
missing from Google Documents is a

446
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,920
really and this is the world's best one

447
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,759
uh I I'm it's a it's I'm impressed that

448
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,040
they can pull this off and then you get

449
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
feedbacks and Friends of course to get

450
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,360
feedbacks and friends if you're writing

451
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,880
to a deadline you actually have to get

452
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,480
it done early which seems to be science

453
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,199
fiction for graduate students at least

454
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
but get it done early then he gives you

455
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,759
time to give your friends feedback you

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,360
can iterate and if you don't do that if

457
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,800
you're writing something for review then

458
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,759
who's your reviewer it's the program

459
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,440
committee and what I've seen sitting on

460
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,000
program committees is a lot of the times

461
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
the paper gets rejected not because you

462
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,399
didn't do something it's because the

463
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
program committee didn't understand what

464
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,800
you did and why if you interact with

465
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,920
Outsiders you've got this chance of

466
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,480
clearing that up that if you don't as

467
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,240
suppos if you just look at it yourself

468
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,000
okay how to write not write bad papers

469
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,199
bad talks basically do the opposite of

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,839
the bad Commandments there's two parts

471
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,559
preparation and practice uh most people

472
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,319
take about two minutes a slide for some

473
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,959
reason I take one minute a slide I don't

474
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,839
know why um you should plan on that a

475
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,640
minute or a minute and a half so you

476
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,919
have plenty of time and leave time for

477
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,079
questions since that's some of the most

478
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,280
important parts don't despite Google

479
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,080
Engineers putting in spinning text you

480
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,600
know don't do

481
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,120
that uh and then you know it's not a

482
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,919
speech it's the first time you do it

483
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,799
it's a talk so you don't have to

484
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,120
memorize it but have notes

485
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,480
ready practice uh is the key uh you want

486
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,400
to do dry runs with friends to get

487
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,960
feedback if you're giving a professional

488
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,919
talk you know the way you make

489
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,600
impression is not only to give a talk

490
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
but how you answer the questions I think

491
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
for those of us in the field a while

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,520
when you see somebody give a dynamic

493
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,400
talk and they really nail the questions

494
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,320
you pay attention to that

495
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,720
uh and then so your practice ought to

496
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,960
have really tough questions so you can

497
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,440
practice the tough questions and then uh

498
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,960
with modern cell phones uh you can

499
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,520
record yourself you not only your audio

500
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,640
you can watch yourself it's you know I

501
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,880
got to tell you it's going to be a

502
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,559
humbling experience you'll hear the

503
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,360
crutches that you have in your verbal

504
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,000
speech I start a lot of sentences with

505
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,919
so I say h you'll be shocked how bad it

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,960
is but everybody does it and this is the

507
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,400
way you get better and I practice

508
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
everything I I think of it I practice my

509
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,799
talks just to show the students you're

510
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
supposed to practice your talks but I

511
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,039
practice my Award acceptance speeches

512
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,360
and they tear them

513
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,600
apart I would think an accepted speech

514
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,600
was pretty good but no no they get make

515
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,559
them better so

516
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,679
practice okay now uh the other thing

517
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,360
that I was going to do in this talk is

518
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,200
uh is quote Richard Hamming Richard

519
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,600
Hamming actually came to Berkeley when I

520
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,240
was young and Professor a laral

521
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,440
professor and he gave this talk you and

522
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,120
your research which is more or less how

523
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,120
to do great research like me and so uh

524
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,280
Richard Hamming of Hamming code you know

525
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,960
Hamming distance the Reon memories don't

526
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,280
make mistakes uh spent his career mostly

527
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,760
at Bell labs and it's pretty clear from

528
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,159
watching these videos he's a very

529
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,240
opinionated guy he he doesn't he's not

530
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,480
say well maybe you should do this he

531
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,559
says do this but he watched careers over

532
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Bell Labs he saw people fail he saw

533
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,960
people succeed and I'll quote quote him

534
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,520
show one minute seconds every time so

535
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
this is him talking about the importance

536
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,360
of communication and you'll get his

537
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,080
personality from this

538
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,600
one which brings me to the topic of

539
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,960
communication you need to learn to

540
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,320
communicate orally in talks like this

541
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,919
written and written reports and Casual

542
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,000
conversations in the middle of a

543
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,039
conference you have to be able to get up

544
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,360
and say that's wrong for these reasons

545
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:55,200
bing bing bing bing and you win if you

546
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,360
sit around and say well I'll write a

547
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,159
report tomorrow after I've thought about

548
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,559
it some more the decision is made we go

549
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,720
ahead and it doesn't matter what you do

550
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,600
then the ability to communicate at three

551
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,400
levels now how do you learn it you can

552
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,640
read books if you want to but forget it

553
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,880
the way you learn as far as I'm

554
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,120
concerned is every time you go to a talk

555
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,440
you listen not only to the talk but to

556
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,360
the style it's done what talks are

557
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,880
effective why were they effective what

558
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,480
aspects of the speaker could you

559
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,640
adapt okay that's for Hamming and then

560
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,120
which brings me to the topic of

561
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,360
communication oops you need to learn to

562
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,440
communicate

563
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,880
or it talks like stop

564
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,600
stop uh and then he uh and there's

565
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,480
another he gave this talk lots of times

566
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,640
this is the one it's on your YouTube

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
right that's how I found it but there

568
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,400
was a text one before and he said in my

569
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,360
early days I think you should spend as

570
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,640
much time in polishing and presenting as

571
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
you did in the original research now at

572
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,760
least 50% of it has to go in the

573
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,039
presentation now if you know hamming's

574
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,080
idea of the me of how do you encode

575
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,360
memory it's beautifully presented that

576
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,240
almost everybody can understand so that

577
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,200
was an example of him he thought not

578
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,000
just came up with the math but he laid

579
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
it out and had a very simple encoding

580
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,440
thing it's almost like a parlor trick is

581
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
you can put a bit pattern in there and

582
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,559
tell you which one is wrong from the way

583
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
he does it he made it very easy to

584
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,279
understand and as a result every single

585
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,880
computer in the world uses his idea but

586
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,200
that was an example of him following his

587
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,880
old advice this come

588
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,039
on right I think I can get and stopped

589
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,440
okay uh okay leading a project now I'm

590
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,880
going to go through through the uh uh I

591
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,440
think I said

592
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,559
this

593
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,039
um so academics have bad benchmarks

594
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,120
papers or maybe even citations rather

595
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,080
than impact is what you're trying to do

596
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,600
I didn't realize when I started there's

597
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,159
I have six phases for leading your

598
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,559
project and we'll go through the

599
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,080
selecting a problem picking a solution

600
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,679
running a project finishing a project

601
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,320
evaluating it transferring technology so

602
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,400
let me go through each of those let's go

603
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,720
back Richard Hamming again he's going to

604
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,440
talk about the a problem and so I said

605
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,840
do mind if I join you so I sit down and

606
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,520
we start talk about chemistry and said

607
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,320
set the set the stage here so so here's

608
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,880
this pretty opinionated guy who studies

609
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,760
how people can be great he's it's kind

610
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,039
of a hobby of his so he at Bell lab's

611
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,279
you know one of the greatest research

612
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,080
institutions in the history of this

613
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,159
country he's been having lunch with

614
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,720
physicists but they all they started

615
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,360
winning Nobel prizes inventing the

616
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,559
transistor and things like that and got

617
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,960
promoted so he had to find a new group

618
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,880
so he decided to hang out with the

619
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,480
chemist so he just kind of butts his way

620
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,240
in as this Outsider uh to talk with the

621
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:43,039
chemists other things for a long while

622
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,679
and finally one day I walk in and say if

623
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,200
what you're working on is not important

624
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,080
and it's not likely to lead to important

625
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,080
things why are you working on

626
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,760
it after that I ate with the engineers

627
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,120
that was spring in the fall Going Down

628
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,279
The Long Corridor Bell Labs my friend

629
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,760
chem stopped me and said you know

630
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,400
Hamming that remark of yours got

631
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,840
underneath my skin I've spent the summer

632
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,159
thinking about the important problems in

633
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,039
my field I have not changed my research

634
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:21,279
but I think it was well worth the time I

635
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:23,480
say thank you Dave and walk on about two

636
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,919
weeks later I know he made head of the

637
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
department about 10 or 12 years ago I

638
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,640
notic he is member of the National

639
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,960
Academy of engineering

640
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,480
I have never heard of anything about any

641
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,000
other person that chemistry table not

642
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,640
one the one man who could hear if what

643
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,360
you're doing is not important not likely

644
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,440
important why are you doing it the one

645
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,720
man who could did become important he

646
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,840
did succeed the rest of them who

647
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,480
couldn't hear

648
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,960
didn't it's that

649
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,840
simple if you don't work on important

650
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,520
problems you are not going to do

651
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,880
important things except by the dumbest

652
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,320
of dumb

653
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,799
luck and you realize when he's giving

654
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,440
these talks the chemist that he was

655
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,120
sitting with were still around I could

656
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,120
hear him give these

657
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,000
talks that's Charming

658
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,880
guy okay so picking selecting a problem

659
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,120
when I started Berkeley I just jumped in

660
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,360
and I'll tell you about it in the next

661
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,399
one invent a new field and stick to it

662
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,520
no try to do real stuff make sure other

663
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,440
people think it's important not not just

664
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,039
you uh it's particularly easy to do that

665
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,600
in Academia you're aiming for this

666
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,880
positive impact big impact on computer

667
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,360
science and

668
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,480
engineering uh and stick to it to your

669
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,840
whole career I I think in this fast

670
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,840
that's not what I did in this fast

671
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,279
moving field why not instead do a bunch

672
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,520
of short projects because a lot of

673
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,039
research projects aren't going to

674
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,480
work uh it always the these things

675
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,760
always take longer than you expect uh

676
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,399
and you know how are you going to know

677
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,480
if you work on something for 20 years

678
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,000
that this is going to be an important

679
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,919
problem for 20

680
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,480
years and what we found by doing lots of

681
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
five-year projects is that learning was

682
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
more of the number of projects than it

683
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,919
was the number of years as you tackle

684
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,840
something it was the new thing you

685
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,080
learned

686
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,720
from uh and then a lot of times as I'll

687
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,840
say research doesn't work out and you'd

688
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,640
like to fail you know fail sooner rather

689
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,640
than fail

690
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,679
later uh what's worked well for us is

691
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
multidisiplinary multi-investigator

692
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,080
projects trying to have somebody from

693
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,840
multiple fields on a single

694
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,000
team uh and then to try and figure out

695
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,679
the strength and weaknesses of your

696
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,279
local environment at universities are

697
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,320
different there strengths that obviously

698
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,880
Google has that and there's weaknesses

699
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,080
too so try and figure out something that

700
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,120
matches your

701
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,480
environment and make sure it's exciting

702
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,760
that you want to work on it for several

703
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,120
years and what I've found is a

704
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,399
compelling prototype that can if we can

705
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,399
build this thing it's really going to be

706
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,279
amazing is is

707
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,000
inspirational okay so that's selecting

708
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,880
the problem my first project when I got

709
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,760
to Berkeley 40 years ago I spent about a

710
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
week thinking about it in joining some

711
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,480
other faculty and it was ridiculously

712
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,320
ridiculously ambitious three Hardware

713
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,720
faculty we're design our own instruction

714
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,960
set build our own chips build our own

715
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,840
interconnection network switches board

716
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,279
systems operating systems we didn't have

717
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
any experience in any of it we didn't

718
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,679
have any research funding we didn't have

719
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,399
any Computing or CAD tools so what

720
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,799
happened from all that you know a couple

721
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,679
of papers right not bad for academics

722
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,760
fortunately I took a a sabatical during

723
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,559
that time and went away and gave me

724
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,080
chance to think about things differently

725
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
and I came back and did the rist stuff

726
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,320
otherwise I wouldn't have uh tenure

727
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,320
today uh picking a solution let

728
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,960
complexity be your guide no keep things

729
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,120
simple unless you've got a really good

730
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,520
reason not to uh I came up with this

731
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,279
phrase early in my career is

732
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,840
intelligence beans on any project you

733
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,799
have a sack of intelligence beans that

734
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,799
you get to spend so decide where you

735
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,360
want to spend your intelligence beans uh

736
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,799
and then where it doesn't matter you

737
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
know you can use the common Solutions

738
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,600
and the best result you can possibly get

739
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,399
is afterwards for them to say anyone

740
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,399
could have thought of that right that

741
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,559
doesn't seem so complicated anybody

742
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,080
could have thought that that's that

743
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,840
you've achieved things well complexity

744
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,840
costs everything you know longer design

745
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,640
construction testing and debugging and

746
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,360
these delays lessen the impact of what

747
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
you do so try and keep it simple it's

748
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,520
hard to keep things simple but that's

749
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,120
the goal the computer scientific nope

750
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,520
you want to run experiments to discover

751
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,039
real problems is my John oout says you

752
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,120
use your intuition to ask questions not

753
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,799
to answer them we're really smart people

754
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,320
we can make up what we think the answer

755
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,480
is but that doesn't mean they're right

756
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
what we need is to figure out the

757
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,039
experiments to figure out the real

758
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,600
answers so you know at Berkeley they

759
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,039
asked me well how do you how do you pick

760
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,080
a problem and solution uh what we've

761
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,519
done over the these years these fiveyear

762
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,360
projects

763
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,120
is uh we start before the end of one

764
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,760
project we start meeting for at least a

765
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,240
year to start talking about the next one

766
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,320
we spend that much time thinking about

767
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
it typically what we've done is saying

768
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,519
what are some interesting technology

769
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,480
trends that are happening over the next

770
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,159
5 or 10 years that will shape the future

771
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,480
of computing 8 to 10 years out to see if

772
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,200
the mix of these Trends have some new

773
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,919
opportunity for risk it was probably uh

774
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,320
computer scientists were were being able

775
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,360
to do uh integrated circuit design there

776
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,679
was Morris law that was taking off so a

777
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,200
32-bit microprocessor was plausible

778
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:30,159
what's the right way to design such a

779
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,679
microprocessor for raid uh personal

780
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
personal computers were getting popular

781
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,559
they started building hard diss for them

782
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,799
these socalled small hard diss they were

783
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:41,159
in expensive uh performance for for

784
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,480
input output was slow processors were

785
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,880
getting faster risk this performance was

786
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,320
slow maybe we could do something with a

787
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,240
lot of them uh for the network or

788
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,679
workstation projects not only were

789
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,080
workstations getting really fast but

790
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,080
there were beginning to be uh local area

791
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,720
network switches can we just build a big

792
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,799
computer out of a bunch of these

793
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,039
components and then how that

794
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,440
work uh you know another thing that

795
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,559
we've noticed over the years is when

796
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,760
you're all by yourself and you're going

797
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,720
to work in a new field it's very scary

798
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,240
but if there's a group of you with

799
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,519
different areas and you kind of go after

800
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,159
this thing there's kind of safety in

801
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,000
numbers you aren't all risking your

802
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,799
careers working on machine learning but

803
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,480
the three of you working together seems

804
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:26,080
not quite as scary to be able to do

805
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,840
that and uh you know the big thing is to

806
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,679
when You' got these ideas is to find

807
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,240
people people whose opinion you trust

808
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,399
and try and uh get their feedback to

809
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,120
help you shape your vision you don't

810
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,919
have to do exactly what they say but you

811
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,200
ought to hear what they're say and then

812
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,919
pick a good name the Apparently in some

813
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,120
parallel universe I'm in the marketing

814
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,960
department but uh it's not that hard you

815
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,240
know I have these friends who show off

816
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,640
their their Latin education who pick

817
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,279
some name nobody can possibly spell and

818
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,360
they even have a word for it now you

819
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,720
pick the name and then you back fill in

820
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
the acronym and so they're called

821
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,360
backronyms right nobody's ever going to

822
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,039
remember that the the pro one of the

823
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,000
projects my younger colleagues picked is

824
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,200
a Spire it's actually 11 or 12 words

825
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,039
nobody but him can remember it so if

826
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,679
that's true you're you're going to use

827
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,960
the acronym model it's got to be three

828
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,640
or four letters if anybody's going to

829
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,320
remember it uh you want to the way we do

830
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,559
it is put a bunch of words on the on the

831
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
wall that describes the project vowels

832
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,640
are really valuable and you want to try

833
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,080
three or four letters three or four

834
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
letters that are an English word that

835
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,519
kind of have something to do with the

836
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,519
project so but I'm a available as a

837
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,039
consultant uh running a project do you

838
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,159
want to avoid feedback uh that's one of

839
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,080
themes no we do these periodic project

840
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,360
reviews with Outsiders we've been doing

841
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,200
them for 30 years twice a year three day

842
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,919
how many people here have been to uh

843
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,480
Berkeley style Retreat all right that's

844
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:56,559
like a dozen people here

845
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:59,639
uh and um we The Outsiders are valued

846
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,480
and you know it's huge benefits to doing

847
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:03,919
this uh at the end we get the feedback

848
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,320
from everybody and we don't argue with

849
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,480
that feedback we try and understand it

850
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,840
it also creates deadlines which are

851
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,639
tough in everywhere but particularly in

852
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,320
Academia builds team

853
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,600
spirit and for the people working on it

854
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,720
gives them a chance to communicate and

855
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,399
spread their ideas interact with with

856
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,840
others uh consider midcourse correction

857
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,720
our first project that I was doing was a

858
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,919
a multiprocessor the risk ideas were

859
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,919
just starting to catch on but they

860
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,120
hadn't been commercial yet but by Midway

861
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,240
through the project there were

862
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,919
commercial chips like myips and Spark we

863
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,679
should have redirected our project to be

864
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
use the commercial processors but I felt

865
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,159
like that was you know breaking our

866
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,000
promise and you know we should have

867
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,480
stuck the ones we did customly but we

868
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,600
would had a much bigger impact with a

869
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,200
multiprocessor risk project then if we'

870
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,399
use commercial instruction set so that's

871
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,240
part of our culture now it's a five-year

872
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:54,720
project two and a half years in maybe

873
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,320
the world has changed in some way and

874
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,399
you should take advantage of it an

875
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,960
example of that would have been the rad

876
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,039
lab which was a couple of projects ago

877
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,880
we were doing internet services and then

878
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,360
cloud computing got popular in it so we

879
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,080
you know embraced that and that became a

880
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,480
big theme of the red

881
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,279
lab uh pick the size the members of the

882
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,000
team

883
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,679
carefully uh you know tough

884
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,399
personalities are hard in everybody not

885
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,360
just tough personalities for faculty

886
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,399
even tough personalities for students

887
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,679
right you know it it can make it no fun

888
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,399
to come to work so trying and get good

889
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,760
people I think Berkeley consciously

890
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,159
tries not to hire Pradas which makes it

891
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,159
nicer and if you know if you have one

892
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,480
expert per area it's a little easier my

893
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,880
colleague Kathy yelick I've got opinions

894
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,799
about programming language and compilers

895
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,639
but when she speaks you know I listen

896
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,919
right I don't and that makes it easier

897
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:42,760
to do things don't be distracted by

898
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,399
others this is not going to be so

899
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,399
radical for you guys but about 10 years

900
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:50,120
ago we went to an open uh uh

901
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,320
collaborative thing where we got rid of

902
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,639
Faculty offices what was happening is

903
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,240
that the students were staying home

904
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,279
because the computers were just as fast

905
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,720
and the network just as fast as home as

906
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,200
they were at work and whether this is

907
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,919
good for a company or not I'll leave to

908
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
you but it's terrible for research

909
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,600
because it's not just put your head down

910
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,519
and plow ahead we got to talk to people

911
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,760
because you're not sure where you're

912
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,480
supposed to be

913
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,760
going uh so we put it into the open

914
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,240
space uh and what now that I've read

915
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
about it what you're shooting for is

916
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,720
communication and concentration so

917
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,960
people can come in work they have to be

918
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,320
able to concentrate enough to get the

919
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,120
work done but you want to have

920
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,519
spontaneous communication which leads to

921
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,679
Innovation so bump into each other and

922
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,039
have meeting

923
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,559
rooms uh we've got the meeting rooms

924
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,120
optimized for discussions and phone

925
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,880
calls we came Jeff Waltz brought us

926
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,440
probably 10 years ago and we saw what

927
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,320
you guys did with your conference rooms

928
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,519
and we imitated that uh at uh and like

929
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,760
you guys we have kitchens and free

930
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,880
drinks we can't we can't do food but uh

931
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,840
we can do drinks um and amazing thing it

932
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,399
accelerates research who would have

933
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,159
thought space could accelerate research

934
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,440
uh it it was uh startling uh what

935
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,960
happened we went from faculty offices

936
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,480
that had kind of whiteboards there that

937
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,159
were filled with faculty reminders when

938
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,000
you came in you got to work on like one

939
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,040
square foot to put your ID in there

940
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,119
instead we had giant whiteboards uh

941
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,760
there was no writing pres you couldn't

942
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,280
reserve it in the high-tech way we

943
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,200
copied it was with the cell phones uh it

944
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,919
came stimulating people came in more

945
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,320
there was more spontaneous

946
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,919
meetings uh and then we noticed the 0 to

947
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,919
60 time for new people went incredibly

948
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,119
faster in by having that kind kind of

949
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,040
environment so mate zaharia the uh in

950
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,320
his second semester there he gave a talk

951
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,520
at Carnegie melan and we'd never had

952
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,200
anybody do that before Nam mat zaharia

953
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,399
who's the founder of spark did a lot of

954
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,040
good things but it wasn't obvious then

955
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,200
that he was going to be that good as it

956
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,599
turned out and so maybe that had

957
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,000
something to do with

958
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,599
it uh and so Richard Hamming has

959
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,399
opinions on this based on his

960
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,599
experience which I'm sure you're not

961
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,839
surprised okay he's got two opinions the

962
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,000
first one is open versus closed doors

963
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,119
and the only way he can have this

964
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,640
opinion was to keep track of all of his

965
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,200
colleagues which ones kept the doors

966
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,920
closed which ones open which ones were

967
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,200
successful and he's here's his

968
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,480
ideas the example I've given you already

969
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,720
is working with a door closed or opener

970
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
if you work with your door closed you

971
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,560
won't be interrupted you get your work

972
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,200
done you work with your door open people

973
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,000
come byy and stop and chat and so on and

974
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,160
so

975
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,040
on but I've noticed very clearly at B

976
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,240
Laboratories those who were with the

977
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,800
door shut may be working just as hard 10

978
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,880
years later but they don't know what to

979
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,000
work on they are not connected with the

980
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,880
reality those who had the door open may

981
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,839
very well know what's

982
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,079
important now I cannot prove to you

983
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,040
whether the open door causes the open

984
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,280
mind or whe the open mind causes the

985
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,280
open door I Su suspect a both I can only

986
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
establish the correlation and it was

987
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,880
quite

988
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,319
spectacular almost always

989
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,680
the guy with the door closed were often

990
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,359
very well able very gifted but they seem

991
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,000
to work always on slightly the wrong

992
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,160
problem so you have to get wide feeling

993
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,520
for what is going

994
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,960
on okay and then he believed that so

995
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,560
much that this is how his his patterns

996
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,000
how he handled Friday afternoons about

997
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,680
the importance especially for

998
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,680
researchers you can start work really

999
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,560
hard but you could miss the really

1000
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,640
important thing if by not

1001
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,440
interacting at the urging of some other

1002
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,880
people partly and partly in my own I

1003
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,560
used to set aside Friday noon and Friday

1004
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,240
afternoon for great thoughts meaning yes

1005
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,240
I'll answer a telephone yes I'll sign a

1006
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,440
sheet of paper but mainly what is the

1007
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,480
effect of computing on

1008
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,440
science what the hell am I doing with

1009
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,280
this Computing

1010
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,280
machine how is it going to affect

1011
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,960
AT&T what should I be doing with

1012
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,319
Computing what is the nature of

1013
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,920
software my friends after a while I got

1014
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,920
to know Friday afternoon's great

1015
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,240
thoughts what's the nature of this that

1016
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,720
and the other thing I spent 10% of my

1017
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,400
time trying to answer the question what

1018
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,839
are the important problems in my field

1019
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,839
10% Friday afternoon straight

1020
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,560
through don't do it Monday morning

1021
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,880
because you'll be interrupted

1022
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,400
immediately if you do it Friday

1023
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,720
afternoon someone can linger around the

1024
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,640
Saturday and Sunday if you do it Monday

1025
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,800
morning there a hot conference at 10:00

1026
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,640
in Bingo everything's broken up I use it

1027
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,880
Friday afternoon for many many years I I

1028
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,079
recommend that you find a regular time

1029
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,240
to stop and think what are the important

1030
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,640
things what is going on what is the

1031
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,960
nature of what you are

1032
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,440
doing what is the characteristic of the

1033
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,599
job what are the fundamentals behind it

1034
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,640
so you have some idea of where you're

1035
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,280
headed so you can March in a uniform

1036
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,720
Direction and get far rather than being

1037
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,720
a drunken sail and getting

1038
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,599
nowhere you're free to not ignore his

1039
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,400
advice but then your career is that of a

1040
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,920
drunken sailor okay

1041
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,400
okay finishing your project I'll talk

1042
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,800
about this some uh if people count the

1043
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,359
number of projects you finish not the

1044
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,359
ones you start right uh and successful

1045
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:13,240
projects go through this unglamorous

1046
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,560
hard phase of of trying to finish it and

1047
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,960
it's because design is a lot more fun

1048
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,520
it's a lot more fun to design things to

1049
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,119
make stuff

1050
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,160
work but uh you know some positive

1051
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,000
things Fred Brooks one of my hero says

1052
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,520
there's no winners on a losing team no

1053
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,800
losers on a winning team if if you win

1054
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,640
anybody in no matter what they did they

1055
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,560
win improve productivity of team members

1056
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,920
how can you do that uh organize each day

1057
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,839
when are figuring out when you're most

1058
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
alert uh when you need a nap or exercise

1059
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,520
or

1060
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,160
sleep uh when how often should you be

1061
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,079
reading and writing uh programming and

1062
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,839
email and what I found it for successful

1063
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,319
colleagues they always used to do this

1064
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,319
you know daily weekly and even every six

1065
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:59,160
months to see how they're doing on their

1066
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:00,960
career uh these days there's this idea

1067
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,960
of agile scrum where you meet in the

1068
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,319
same place at the same time and do

1069
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,200
Sprints I think this is a pretty

1070
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,520
effective

1071
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,680
model and then reduce a project so if

1072
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,720
it's late again Fred Brooks said adding

1073
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,119
people to a late project makes it later

1074
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,880
in his classic book the mythical man

1075
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,839
month uh and finishing a project is how

1076
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,520
you acquire taste how do you get gr

1077
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,480
taste if you don't finish it you don't

1078
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,200
know really what wrong and it helps you

1079
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,880
pick good problems and find Simple

1080
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,400
Solutions okay and then my friend John

1081
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,680
Hennessy I guess uh president Stanford

1082
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,440
said this a long time ago you can

1083
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,920
quickly tell whether or not the authors

1084
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,079
have ever built something and made it

1085
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,520
work and if you never make it work you

1086
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,520
don't acquire that taste evaluating

1087
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,960
quantitatively never be proven wrong uh

1088
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,520
nope if you can't be proven wrong then

1089
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
you can't be proven

1090
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,560
right and you have to you know we need

1091
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,839
reproducible results you're trying to

1092
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,920
get people to use your ideas if they

1093
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,720
can't reproduce them they're not going

1094
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,319
to take your word for

1095
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,640
it so and you know for better for worse

1096
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,760
benchmarks shaper field and especially

1097
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,839
in the commercial world if we have good

1098
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,640
ones it accelerates progress bad ones

1099
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:09,720
then there's a choice between helping

1100
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,119
sales or helping customers and often

1101
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,119
sales

1102
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:17,359
wins and then transferring technology

1103
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,800
it's not just you write a paper and

1104
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,400
everybody starts using it uh you have to

1105
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,599
go out and stump it uh you know this

1106
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,920
last year there's a RIS five which is an

1107
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,359
effort to be able to have an open

1108
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,079
instruction set so that be an open

1109
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,160
alternative kind of like Linux is to

1110
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,720
Microsoft Windows so I gave talks at the

1111
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,119
you know at 10 universities this fall to

1112
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,599
try and get the word out then if they

1113
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,359
kind of like the ideas then they read

1114
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
the

1115
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,640
papers uh it of course you know if you

1116
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,560
don't pick a good problem people aren't

1117
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,920
going to be that interested and you can

1118
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,480
tell if it's a good problem if more

1119
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,920
people get interested over time rather

1120
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,480
than your start to do that I think I'm

1121
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,359
persuasive the way I change Minds is

1122
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,359
with believable numbers and so the you

1123
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,880
have to collect that quantitatively and

1124
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,760
believe it the other thing I learned

1125
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,800
late in my career is your personality

1126
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,880
affects technology transfer there's this

1127
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,839
person who I won't name who had a bunch

1128
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,200
of interesting ideas and people wouldn't

1129
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,839
use them and I talk to people in

1130
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,920
Industry about they hated that guy they

1131
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,280
hated that guy if there was any other

1132
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,760
way to do it at all they would use it

1133
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,599
because they would that would the last

1134
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,440
thing they would do so you could be a

1135
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,800
jerk if you have the only possible

1136
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
solution but it's kind of hard to do

1137
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
that in Computing maybe in biology you

1138
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,800
can do that

1139
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,040
uh and then product groups people don't

1140
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,520
want to change product groups there's

1141
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,560
risk associated with change so it's

1142
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,760
worked for us uh and and this goes back

1143
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,119
so Fred Brooks when he was a graduate

1144
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,280
student his advisor was Howard Ain and

1145
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,680
he Fred Brooks says I think these people

1146
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
are going to steal your idea these

1147
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,520
companies are looking at his idea at

1148
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,440
Harvard University a drum memory System

1149
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,839
Watch Out Howard and what Akin said in

1150
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,280
southern ACC the problem in this

1151
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,800
business isn't to keep people from

1152
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,440
stealing your ideas it's making them

1153
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,400
steal your ideas and that's that's still

1154
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,480
true today 65 years later so what's

1155
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,760
worked for us is to find one gold bold

1156
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,200
group often not the leaders but some

1157
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,480
bold group willing to take a shot on it

1158
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,839
and they are successful and then kind of

1159
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,480
the rest of the field is well and for us

1160
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,720
it was Sun Microsystems for risk and EMC

1161
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,880
for raid and Inky and then Google for

1162
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,400
networks of workstations but it's kind

1163
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:27,000
of like the rest of the field oh damn

1164
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,119
they tried it it works okay we'll change

1165
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,079
right

1166
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,440
people don't really as much as people

1167
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,760
enjoy ideas they don't want to take the

1168
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,520
risk and then the other way of

1169
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,480
transferring technology is to start a

1170
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,680
company in my 40 Years everybody I've

1171
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,400
talked to who's worked for a startup

1172
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,920
likes it doing it once they they they

1173
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,599
they absolutely now there's some people

1174
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,960
who love doing it more than once a lot

1175
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,400
of people once is enough but they

1176
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,559
everybody thinks it was useful they

1177
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,960
learn a lot uh and then if it works you

1178
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,440
know it works out you see not just your

1179
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,839
ideas but the product and of course you

1180
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,680
can po L make a lot of money if that

1181
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:04,160
works out and become famous the

1182
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,000
downsides are that you know you learn

1183
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,319
about things you might not want to learn

1184
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,720
about but uh and particularly lawsuits

1185
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,280
my friends who lawsuits that's less fun

1186
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,800
and you don't get to do research and

1187
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,480
development uh and then only 10% of the

1188
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,160
startups make it right but but

1189
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,680
nevertheless everybody thinks it was

1190
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,720
worth it that for once in their life

1191
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,880
maybe when you're younger so I didn't

1192
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,440
really realize that there were six roles

1193
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,319
to being a leader of a project and it

1194
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,520
changes over time uh but that's uh

1195
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,359
that's what I believe now now so

1196
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,960
wrapping things up and there's time for

1197
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,119
questions here is the goal is to have

1198
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,200
impact is to change the way people do

1199
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,240
Computing and Engineering a positive way

1200
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:49,680
now I we do these five-year projects now

1201
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,119
that my career is uh ending I've I will

1202
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,520
do 12 right they overlap so I I've been

1203
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,079
there 40 years not 60 years you can't

1204
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,559
tell if a Project's successful for at

1205
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,720
least 10 years and

1206
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,839
the good news is three of them looked

1207
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,000
like they were pretty successful they 10

1208
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,200
years old so that's like kind of 25%

1209
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,160
batting average which so I'm glad I did

1210
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,839
a lot of projects uh there's two that

1211
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,720
are finished but haven't uh you know it

1212
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,720
hasn't been 10 years the rad lab did

1213
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,880
spark and mesos those seem promising the

1214
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,960
par lab did communication avoiding

1215
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,040
algorithms Jim demo and this RIS five

1216
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,559
stuff but you know we it'll take five or

1217
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,720
seven years to know how significant it

1218
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:28,319
was so maybe I'll get up to you know

1219
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,920
five out of 12 which is like 40% but

1220
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,480
most of the projects don't work so I'm

1221
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,040
glad I did short

1222
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,000
projects uh so solve a problem other

1223
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,800
people care about you taste that you

1224
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,480
acquire by finishing projects and then

1225
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,960
uh whoops and and so okay and and I

1226
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,800
think the key theme of running over my

1227
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,599
career is is feedback is figuring out

1228
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,040
ways to get feedback okay with that I'm

1229
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,040
ready for

1230
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,640
questions I think there a microphone

1231
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,559
here oh there's one okay

1232
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,720
questions without the first question

1233
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,839
there won't be multiple question oh

1234
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,839
there

1235
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,920
is since you asked for hard questions

1236
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,400
which of your projects did you enjoy the

1237
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,880
most and which of them do you think had

1238
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,440
the most impact which did I enjoy the

1239
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,559
most ah I let me do the most impact I

1240
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,280
because I'm kind of wrapping things up I

1241
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,559
it's plausible raid had the biggest

1242
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,520
impact

1243
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:33,400
uh it's everybody uses it you know uh

1244
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,720
the pap the original raid paper won

1245
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,720
three test of time

1246
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,040
Awards uh I I you know if I had it looks

1247
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,480
to me as a as if I try to be a neutral

1248
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,880
Observer probably raid is the most uh

1249
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,440
significant so far which one did I enjoy

1250
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,319
the most I try and always make projects

1251
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,359
that I really love right I try to make

1252
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,000
projects that if I was a graduate

1253
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,160
student I just die to work on this

1254
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,319
project uh

1255
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,680
um you know that's

1256
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:06,599
hard uh maybe children yeah which of my

1257
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,040
children do I love the

1258
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,280
most I don't know the good thing about

1259
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,040
all the projects whether or not they

1260
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,400
they're home runs is they produce great

1261
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,200
students and uh and I didn't say that in

1262
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,240
the slide there's almost 300 students in

1263
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,920
those 12 projects that that have uh that

1264
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,240
which was uh I was had fun adding that

1265
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,240
number

1266
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,920
up Jeff

1267
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,599
so this isn't really a problem for for

1268
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,559
most of us here but would you give

1269
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,400
different advice to a pre-tenure

1270
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,400
academic versus a post- tenure academic

1271
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,720
or do you think you can do the kinds of

1272
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,920
thing you're talking about and not

1273
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,960
compromise your chances of getting

1274
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,880
tenure yeah so people ask me that

1275
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,800
something so when Hennessy and I did the

1276
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,319
rist stuff which at the time was hugely

1277
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,400
controversial if you think deep neural

1278
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,920
networks are

1279
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,240
controversial they have the people PE uh

1280
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,800
a faculty member of in other institution

1281
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,280
wrote a a hit piece on me personally

1282
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,520
Dave Patterson's a bad person about and

1283
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,680
we were talking about instruction set

1284
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,160
design you know so you then at but at

1285
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,559
the time you know Hennessy and I were

1286
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,880
saying well uh digital equipment one of

1287
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,040
the leading computer manufacturers in

1288
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,280
the world had a pretty stupid design you

1289
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:19,400
know so yeah so we uh you know we did we

1290
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,680
didn't worry about that also you have to

1291
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,400
believe in what you're doing I just

1292
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,119
can't give the advice to do something

1293
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,040
that uh you don't believe in uh and work

1294
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,160
on that because when in fact when I've

1295
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,920
visited universities and I've seen that

1296
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,440
it's assistant professor telling me well

1297
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,520
I don't really like what I'm working on

1298
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,720
but this is what I have to do to get

1299
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,400
tenure and then I go talk to the

1300
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,640
chairman and this guy's just doing

1301
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,280
incremental stuff he's never going to

1302
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,359
get tenure right there's that Gap there

1303
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,680
uh I you know is when you're larvel you

1304
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,960
need to make sure you publish you know

1305
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,280
you need to go around and give talks and

1306
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,599
stuff like that but I I think you gotta

1307
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,280
do projects you believe

1308
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,839
in otherwise Life's too short to work on

1309
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,839
other things Yeah question here

1310
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:07,040
um so you mentioned a couple times uh

1311
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:09,400
not to be a primadonna um so it's easy

1312
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,280
to identify other people being padas but

1313
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,520
how do you tell if you're being a

1314
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,520
primadonna uh are you

1315
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,680
married my my family is really good at

1316
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,200
pointing out my

1317
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,480
flaws

1318
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,520
uh well I think I think you uh I think

1319
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,559
feedback is the one I go out of way and

1320
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,559
way to get feedback if somebody hates my

1321
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,240
papers I send them new papers because

1322
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,160
they tell me tell me the honest thing to

1323
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,319
do I would like to think if I'm acting

1324
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,880
like a jerk that uh you know I'm pretty

1325
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:42,119
sure my friends or my family would would

1326
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,079
would tell me that I think you could ask

1327
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,920
right I think you you can ask right gez

1328
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,960
people are afraid to tell you something

1329
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,480
if not but I think if you asked did I

1330
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,079
handle that well or not uh you do

1331
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,319
it I think some people in Academia think

1332
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,960
that's the way you uh that's the way

1333
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,400
people know that you're famous you've

1334
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,960
had some success you start acting

1335
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,440
differently and it's just bad career

1336
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,440
advice okay other

1337
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,960
questions so full disclosure I I went to

1338
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,200
Brooklyn and experienced one of these

1339
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,160
projects um so I'm I'm mean was on the

1340
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,359
network workstation project I'm biased

1341
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,799
toward the model uh my question is given

1342
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,040
the success of the model why do you

1343
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:22,640
think more universities haven't adopted

1344
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,240
it I mean even though it seems like the

1345
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,960
stuff you're saying is really obvious

1346
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,640
it's also somewhat rare yeah I got that

1347
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,920
exact same question at Berkeley uh I

1348
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,000
think this time I'll be less humble you

1349
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,160
need you need to you have to have

1350
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,359
somebody who's willing to lead right for

1351
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,640
some reason even though wrestling uh as

1352
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:41,960
I'll tell you I wrestled in high school

1353
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:45,200
and college as an individual sport I had

1354
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,079
great wrestling coaches who realize we'd

1355
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,040
be more successful if we bonded as a

1356
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:50,680
team even though it was individual sport

1357
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,240
so I had that kind of role model going

1358
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,720
up and so I think some I'm good at you

1359
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,880
know kind of organizing teams so you

1360
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,040
have to have somebody who's willing to

1361
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,079
do that the institution itself Berkeley

1362
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,760
told me day one have impact they didn't

1363
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,920
have any problem with with multiple

1364
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,200
people working on it when you're an

1365
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,240
assistant professor you make up rules

1366
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,200
like I have to have only sold auor

1367
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,319
papers otherwise they credit but you you

1368
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,480
that's not that's not true so the

1369
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,680
insation let us happen I think it was

1370
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,240
helpful that you know I'm a good leader

1371
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,200
of people but there's lots of good

1372
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,760
leaders of people around I don't

1373
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,680
understand why they why that doesn't

1374
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,680
happen more it's yeah I said it seems

1375
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,319
common sense you know it's not like I've

1376
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,280
kept this a secret for 4 years I've been

1377
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:32,160
telling people at lost institution so I

1378
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,040
I'm not sure but we're a lunatic fringe

1379
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,799
right we we put a group together it's a

1380
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,559
different group with interdisciplinary

1381
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:42,760
mix and match we tackle a problem we're

1382
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,480
you know we've already visited you guys

1383
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,920
to on the next project to get some

1384
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,960
feedback on it I don't know why more

1385
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,599
people don't do it you have to ask them

1386
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,440
why don't more people you should ask

1387
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:54,000
them why don't you guys act like

1388
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,799
Berkeley I'm sure they'd love

1389
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,839
that there's probably a nearby probably

1390
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,839
a nearby University you

1391
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,359
could yeah I think we have about five

1392
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,200
more five or six more minutes okay I uh

1393
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:11,400
all right with that then I I I need to

1394
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,839
give my uh quickly give my life story

1395
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,799
okay so uh I'm an accidental CS student

1396
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:19,280
I was a math major and wrestler in high

1397
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:21,160
school and college uh the end of my

1398
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,119
junior year the math class was cancelled

1399
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,240
I I had to take a course there was no CS

1400
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,000
major so I just took an intro computer

1401
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,960
science and I was hook that was it my

1402
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,799
senior year I took every computer course

1403
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,200
I

1404
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:36,240
could uh I'm an accidental student at I

1405
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,880
went to uccla graduate student I just

1406
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,920
casually mentioned at the end of one of

1407
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,160
those courses to a new PhD that boy i'

1408
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,520
sure rather do this than work in a

1409
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,400
factory to pay my away the college and

1410
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,040
he on his own went and found me a job as

1411
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,680
undergraduate student um while I was an

1412
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,079
undergraduate student even though it was

1413
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,760
near the end of my senior year that

1414
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,920
wasn't too late to go to graduate school

1415
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
I asked my wife about Master's Degree

1416
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,720
she said sure it's only four or five

1417
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,520
quarters and then when I got into the

1418
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,200
office everybody else in my office was

1419
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,400
getting a PhD so I thought maybe I

1420
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,559
should get a PhD so I decided to do that

1421
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,440
uh we lived on a research assistant

1422
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,880
salaries my wife and two kids and I we

1423
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,119
were at you know poverty level at that

1424
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,079
time and then the project ended I lost

1425
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,640
my ra ship my adviser helped get me a

1426
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,040
job at a Aerospace company H aircraft

1427
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,720
and then it was touch and go whether I'd

1428
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,559
rather finished my PhD because I was

1429
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,599
working 10 I mean 20 30 40 hours but I

1430
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:35,680
did mean it I'm an accidental Berkeley

1431
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:37,319
Professor my wife uh grew up in the

1432
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,880
right next door to Berkeley and when I

1433
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,559
was graduating on the interview tour she

1434
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,839
says I can't help but think you're ended

1435
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,520
up with Berkeley and I said look

1436
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,040
Berkeley's up here 's down here I'm

1437
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,119
graduating this is never going to happen

1438
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,680
but she forced me as a graduate student

1439
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,480
to call the chairman of the department

1440
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,280
at Berkeley computer science to find out

1441
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,160
about my application so I called this

1442
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,000
guy

1443
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,079
he said well Dave you're in the top 10

1444
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,319
but not top five and at the time I'm

1445
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,319
thinking wow that wasn't so bad so turns

1446
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,839
out he said that to anybody who

1447
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:11,920
called but but then he took my

1448
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,200
application yeah that seems interesting

1449
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,240
handed it to somebody visiting Southern

1450
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,480
California we had a good conversation

1451
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:21,040
they invited me back to the interview

1452
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:23,640
and got a job offer I uh barely got

1453
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,599
tenure uh the first project I already

1454
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,480
told you about it was way too ambitious

1455
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,280
uh I did the SA and did the rist stuff

1456
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,960
tenure wasn't easy I was one of those

1457
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,880
guys that was using conferences where

1458
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,880
the whole campus used journals but us so

1459
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,920
I was the guinea pig uh that went

1460
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,559
through that and the risk stuff was

1461
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,160
pretty new but I but I got it after that

1462
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,640
things got better but I still get papers

1463
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,760
rejected by those jerks on the program

1464
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:49,200
committee and so what have I learned

1465
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,040
what works for me uh uh for me it was

1466
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,480
maximizing personal happiness versus

1467
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,599
personal wealth that's always been my

1468
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,440
guideline believe in this country you

1469
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,400
think wealth is happiness there's

1470
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,920
there's unhappy billionaires right in

1471
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,440
this world they're not they're not the

1472
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,440
same thing um family first especially in

1473
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,760
that kind of job you know people ask you

1474
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,920
do things your family can go down the

1475
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,960
list I made my family first so I did we

1476
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,200
had my son wife and I had two sons so I

1477
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,880
did Indian guides I I was the CB scout

1478
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,920
leader I was the soccer coach when there

1479
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,880
were field trips out there so when my

1480
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,559
rebellious teenage boy grew up ah you

1481
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,079
were never there and I said Indian

1482
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,000
guides CB

1483
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:28,359
Scouts so I went down the list and he

1484
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,359
said oh okay maybe

1485
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,400
uh passion courage and optimism you

1486
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,559
might be able to tell I'm a a passionate

1487
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,240
guy I have to believe the thing I'm

1488
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:40,599
doing is uh G to possibly change the

1489
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,240
world my optimism story goes back to uh

1490
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,839
high school I'm dating started dating

1491
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,520
this girl who was dating older guys who

1492
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,880
had Corvettes and stuff like that uh

1493
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,480
nevertheless after a couple dates I

1494
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,760
asked her if she would go steady with me

1495
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,760
as you say at the time she' just been

1496
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,240
dating older guys and didn't know what

1497
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,480
to say she says well I don't know how to

1498
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,319
say no so me being an optimist and a

1499
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,200
logical person not a no as a yes so I

1500
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:08,000
said great and I hugged her and she said

1501
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,680
you know uh you know I'll let this guy

1502
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,799
down later but we've been married 48

1503
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,920
years now so so I think that's okay um

1504
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:18,559
and then yeah I think uh we swing for

1505
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,720
the fences right that's that thing uh

1506
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,920
now another thing this is a saying that

1507
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,359
a colleague told me that's actually a

1508
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,240
couple hundred years old friends come

1509
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:30,039
and go but enemies accumulate uh so this

1510
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,839
kind of ironically the physical courage

1511
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:34,280
that comes with wrestling has to me been

1512
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,960
intellectual courage so when I was

1513
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,799
president of ACM the person in charge of

1514
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,240
darer was cutting back on academic

1515
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,960
funding so I decided to take him on with

1516
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,880
my friend at lazasa in Washington and we

1517
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,760
tried to get people from other

1518
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,520
universities to join us but they were

1519
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,839
afraid this guy would be vengeful and

1520
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,200
cut him off I think with good reason but

1521
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,319
so it was just us taking him on with

1522
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,640
editorials and Science magazine stuff so

1523
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,200
this guy did was not a fan of us now but

1524
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,280
we hadn't quite realized this is

1525
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,640
unintentional but the other saying is

1526
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,400
the enemy of my enemy is my friend so we

1527
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,839
made a lot of

1528
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,440
friends but keep that in mind uh winning

1529
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:14,280
is a team versus IND individual I in My

1530
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:17,000
DNA I believe a team of you know average

1531
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,520
people can work together and beat

1532
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,640
Superstars uh and then uh I've already

1533
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,799
quoted Fred Brooks about that line uh

1534
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,920
seek out honest feedback and learn from

1535
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:27,920
it it's easy to avoid feedback but

1536
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,760
that's you get

1537
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,079
better uh the one warning sign I can

1538
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,119
pass on from my 40 years the always

1539
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,559
dangerous is when somebody thinks they

1540
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,119
the smartest person in the room there's

1541
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,480
a person in my field who thinks he's the

1542
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:43,359
smartest person in the room and

1543
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,319
everybody hates that guy there was a

1544
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,039
president of a university who thought it

1545
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:51,280
smartest that person was fired for doing

1546
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:53,359
a lousy job uh the people who founded

1547
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
Enron uh thought they were the smartest

1548
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,680
people in the room they went to prison

1549
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,559
and and I I even have a relative who

1550
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,599
thought he was the smartest person in

1551
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,640
the room and he's a convicted felon so

1552
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:06,200
the one so why would that be why would

1553
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,359
this person they're probably smart if

1554
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,839
they think they're the smartest why

1555
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,319
would it be such a bad sign I think it's

1556
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,520
that they don't want feedback from

1557
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:14,319
anybody if you're the smartest person in

1558
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,880
the room you don't need to talk to

1559
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,799
anybody about your ideas so I think but

1560
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,000
anyways run away if you find somebody

1561
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:24,960
like that uh this uh thing happened to

1562
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,640
me it was like God spoke in my ear one

1563
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,520
morning and it I remember waking up you

1564
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,039
know and it was it's not how many

1565
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,240
projects you start it's how many you

1566
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,079
finish it was like in my head like

1567
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,359
somebody was telling me what to do so

1568
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:39,559
that's ever since that that's what I've

1569
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,280
done so what I do is one big project at

1570
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:42,839
a time I do other things but there's one

1571
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,920
big thing at a time so when Hennessy and

1572
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:46,760
I were doing our textbook that was the

1573
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,640
big thing that I did that year when I

1574
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,960
was president of ACM I took a sabatical

1575
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,640
so that was the one big thing I did

1576
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,520
there that year and so it turns out if

1577
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,119
you do one big thing a year over 30

1578
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,559
years you can get a lot things done but

1579
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,440
a lot of academics particularly will

1580
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:04,880
work on a thousand things at once and

1581
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,480
not finish very many of them and then

1582
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,240
uh and then have fun you know to be

1583
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,200
successful you do have to work hard you

1584
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,359
know our long lost uh colleague Jim Gray

1585
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,760
even in his 60s he do one all nighter a

1586
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:19,440
month so you have to work hard to be

1587
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,880
successful but you have to have fun uh

1588
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,440
you know as far as we know you only get

1589
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,119
one chance of this and if you get to the

1590
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,640
end without having any fun you've wasted

1591
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:27,200
a lot of opportunities I can put up a

1592
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,680
lot of stuff as as long as I play soccer

1593
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,440
every Sunday I I can have a good time so

1594
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:38,829
that's my advice thanks very much

1595
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:38,829
[Applause]
