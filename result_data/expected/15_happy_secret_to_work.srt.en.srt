1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,810
what's the Millenial question apparently

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,860
Millennials as a generation

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:18,240
a group of people who were born

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:20,970
approximately 1984 and after are tough

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,570
to manage and they're accused of being

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:30,150
entitled and narcissistic

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:33,630
self-interested unfocused lazy but

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,210
entitled is the big one and and because

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,890
they confound leadership so much what's

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,600
happening is leaders are asking the

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,700
Millennials what do you want and

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,270
Millennials are saying we want to work

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,980
in a place with purpose love that we

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,810
want to make an impact you know whatever

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:57,030
that means we want free food and bean

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,380
bags and so somebody articulates some

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,510
sort of purpose there's lots of free

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,820
food and there's bean bags and yet for

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,290
some reason they're still not happy and

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,110
that's because you that they're missing

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,360
there's a there's a missing piece what

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,249
I've learned is that there I can break

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,749
it down into four pieces right there are

24
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:18,240
four four things four characteristics

25
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:19,469
one is parenting the other one is

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,359
technology

27
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,820
third is impatience and the fourth is

28
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,380
environment the generation that we call

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,249
the Millennials too many of them grew up

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:35,249
subject to not my words failed parenting

31
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:37,049
strategies you know where for example

32
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:39,479
they were told that they were special

33
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,549
all the time they were told that they

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,950
have anything they want in life just

35
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,639
because they want it right they were

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,109
told some of them got into honors

37
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,399
classes not because they deserved it but

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,899
because their parents complained and

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,639
some of them got a is not because they

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,389
earned them but because the teachers

41
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:57,569
didn't want to deal with the parents

42
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:59,459
some kids got participation medals they

43
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,649
got a medal for coming in last right

44
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,840
which the science we know is pretty

45
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,399
clear which is it devalues the metal and

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,899
the reward for those who actually work

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,390
hard and that actually makes the person

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,259
who comes in last to feel embarrassed

49
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,600
because they know they didn't deserve it

50
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,280
so actual makes me feel worse right so

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,750
you take this group of people and they

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,939
graduate school and they get a job and

53
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,379
the thrust and turn it into the real

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,209
world and in an instant they find out

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,160
they're not special their moms can't get

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,660
them a promotion

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,220
that you get nothing for coming in last

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,960
and by the way you can't just have it

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,400
because you want it right and in an

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,900
instant the entire self-image is

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,370
shattered and so you have an entire

62
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,470
generation that's growing up with lower

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,670
self-esteem than previous generations

64
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,010
the other problem to compound it is

65
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,450
we're growing up in a facebook Instagram

66
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,280
world in other words we're good at

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,680
putting filters on things we're good at

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,450
showing people that life is amazing even

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,090
though I'm depressed right

70
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,140
and so everybody sounds tough and

71
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,730
everybody sounds like they got it we'll

72
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,260
figure it out and the reality is there's

73
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,730
very little toughness and most people

74
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,770
don't have it figured out and so when

75
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,330
the more senior people say what we do

76
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:04,230
they sound like this is what you got at

77
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:05,790
it and they have no clue so you have an

78
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,110
entire generation growing up with lower

79
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,450
self-esteem than previous generations

80
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,670
right through no fault of their own

81
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,550
through no fault of their own right they

82
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,600
were dealt a bad hand right now let's

83
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,790
add in technology we know that

84
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,980
engagement with social media and our

85
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,720
cell phones releases a chemical called

86
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,730
dopamine that's why when you get a text

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
feels good right

88
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,040
so you know we've all had it or you're

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,900
feeling a little bit down or feeling a

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,670
bit lonely and so you send out ten texts

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,970
to ten friends you know high high high

92
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,480
high high because it feels good when you

93
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,430
get a response right right it's why we

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,830
count the likes it's why we go back ten

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,840
times to see if and if it's going if our

96
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,970
my Instagram is growing slower I would

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,160
do something wrong do they not like me

98
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,550
anymore right the trauma for young kids

99
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,930
to be unfriended right because we know

100
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,730
when you get it you get a hit a dopamine

101
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,890
which feels good it's why we like it

102
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,810
it's why we keep going back to it

103
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,459
dopamine is the exact same chemical that

104
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,580
makes us feel good when we smoke when we

105
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:10,260
drink and when we gamble in other words

106
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,300
it's highly highly addictive right we

107
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,620
have age restrictions on smoking

108
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,540
gambling and alcohol and we have no age

109
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,770
restrictions and social media and cell

110
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,660
phones which is the equivalent of

111
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,370
opening up the liquor cabinet and saying

112
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,750
to our teenagers hey by the way this

113
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,750
adolescence thing if it gets you down

114
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,660
but that's basically what's happening

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,890
that's basically what's happening right

116
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,660
that's basically what happened you have

117
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,870
an entire generation that has access to

118
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,220
an addictive numbing to chemical

119
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,300
dopamine through social media and cell

120
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,520
phones as they're going through the high

121
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,120
stress of adolescents why is this

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
important

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,250
almost every alcoholic discovered

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
alcohol when they were teenagers when

125
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,640
we're very very young the only approval

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,470
we need is the approval of our parents

127
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,300
and as we go through adolescence we make

128
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,300
this transition where we now need the

129
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,130
approval of our peers very frustrating

130
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,020
for our parents very important for us

131
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,520
that allows us to acculturate outside of

132
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,290
our immediate families into the broader

133
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,330
tribe right it's a highly highly

134
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,670
stressful and anxious period of our

135
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,180
lives and we're supposed to learn to

136
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,890
rely on our friends some people quite by

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,870
accident discover alcohol and numbing

138
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,410
effects of dopamine to help them cope

139
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,700
with the stresses and anxieties of

140
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,320
adolescence unfortunately that becomes

141
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,910
hardwired in their brains and for the

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,530
rest of their lives when they suffer

143
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,620
significant stress they will not turn to

144
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,910
a person they will turn to the bottle

145
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,440
social stress financial stress career

146
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,480
stress that's pretty much the primary

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,580
reasons why an alcoholic drinks right

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,860
what's happening is because we're out

149
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,950
allowing unfettered access to these

150
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,060
dopamine producing devices and media

151
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,170
basically it's becoming hardwired and

152
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,980
what we're seeing is as they grow older

153
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,140
they to many kids don't know how to form

154
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,420
deep meaningful relationships their

155
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,800
words not mine they will admit that many

156
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,110
of their friendships are superficial

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,820
they will admit that their friends that

158
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,870
they don't count on their friends they

159
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,000
don't rely on their friends they have

160
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,170
fun with their friends but they also

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,340
know that their friends will cancel out

162
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,050
them that something better comes along

163
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,790
deep meaningful relationships are not

164
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,980
there because they never practice the

165
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,810
skillset and worse they don't have the

166
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,760
coping mechanisms to deal with stress so

167
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,530
when significant stress starts to show

168
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,450
up in their lives they're not turning to

169
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,000
a person they're turning to a device

170
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,020
they're turning to social media they're

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,390
turning to these things which offer

172
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,400
temporary relief we know the science is

173
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,840
clear we know that people who spend more

174
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,070
time on Facebook so far higher rates of

175
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,040
depression than people spend less time

176
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,140
on Facebook write these things balanced

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,510
alcohol is not bad too much alcohol is

178
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,520
bad gambling is fun too much gambling is

179
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,050
dangerous right there's nothing wrong

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,690
with social media and cell phones it's

181
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,940
the imbalance right if you're sitting at

182
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,420
dinner with your friends and you're

183
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,520
texting somebody who's not there that's

184
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,530
a problem that's an addiction if you're

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
sitting in a meeting with people you're

186
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,610
supposed to be listening to and speak

187
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,370
and you put your phone on the table face

188
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,900
up or face down I don't care that sends

189
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,160
a subconscious message to the room that

190
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,170
you're not just you're just not that

191
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,760
important to me right now right that's

192
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,080
what happens and the fact that you

193
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,300
cannot put it away it's because you are

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,830
addicted right if you wake up and you

195
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,240
check your phone before you say good

196
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,580
morning to your girlfriend boyfriend or

197
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,530
spouse you have an addiction and like

198
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,960
all addiction in time it'll destroy

199
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,050
relationships it'll cost time and it'll

200
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,480
cost money and will make your life worse

201
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,010
right so you have a generation growing

202
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,210
up with lower self-esteem that doesn't

203
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,700
have the coping mechanisms to do with

204
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,530
stress stress right now you add in the

205
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,400
sense of impatience right they've grown

206
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,320
up in a world of instant gratification

207
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,240
you want to buy something you go on

208
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,590
Amazon it arrives the next day you want

209
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,090
to watch a movie log on and watch your

210
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,710
movie you don't check movie times you

211
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,360
want to watch your TV show binge you

212
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,850
don't even have to wait week to week to

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,590
week right I know people who skip

214
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,540
seasons just so they can binge at the

215
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,460
end of the season right Instagram if

216
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,930
occasion you want to go on a date you

217
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,930
don't even have to learn how to be like

218
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,790
you don't even have to learn and

219
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,500
practice that skill you don't have to be

220
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,640
the uncomfortable and which this is yes

221
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,080
when you mean known says no when you

222
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,370
mean no but yes when you you have to

223
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,010
swipe right bang I'm a stud right you

224
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,830
don't have to learn the social coping

225
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,170
mechanisms right everything you want you

226
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:20,070
can have instantaneously everything you

227
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,900
want instant gratification except job

228
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,680
satisfaction and strength of

229
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,390
relationships

230
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,990
there ain't no app for that they are

231
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:30,300
slow meandering uncomfortable messy

232
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,400
processes and so I keep meeting these

233
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,740
wonderful fantastic idealistic

234
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,210
hard-working smart kids they've just

235
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,099
graduated school they're in their

236
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,780
entry-level job I sit down with them

237
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,630
when I go how's it going they go I think

238
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,270
I'm going to quit I'm like why they're

239
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:49,530
like I'm not making an impact I'm like

240
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,430
you've been here eight months it's as if

241
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,110
they're standing at the foot of a

242
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,120
mountain and they have this abstract

243
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,130
concept called impact that they want to

244
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,040
have in the world which is the summit

245
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,700
what they don't see is the mountain I

246
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,260
don't care if you go up the mountain

247
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,300
quickly or slowly but there's still a

248
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,529
mountain and so what this young

249
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,560
generation needs to learn

250
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:11,730
is patience that some things that really

251
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,999
really matter like love or job

252
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,879
fulfillment joy love of life

253
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:20,809
self-confidence a skill set any of these

254
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,339
things all of these things take time

255
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:27,269
sometimes you can expedite pieces of it

256
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:30,120
but the overall journey is arduous and

257
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,160
long and difficult and if you don't ask

258
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,809
for help and learn that skill set you

259
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,149
will fall off the mountain or you will

260
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:38,069
the worst case scenario the worst case

261
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,300
scenario and we're already seeing it the

262
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:41,550
worst case scenario is we're seeing

263
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,870
increase in suicide rates we're seeing

264
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,100
an increase in this generation we're

265
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,559
seeing an increase in accidental deaths

266
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,120
due to drug overdoses we're seeing more

267
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,329
and more kids drop out of school or take

268
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,550
leaves of absence due to depression

269
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:56,670
unheard of these are this is this is

270
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,339
really bad the best case scenario the

271
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,259
bet those are all bad cases right the

272
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,420
best case scenario is you'll have an

273
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,709
entire population growing up and going

274
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,350
through life and just never really

275
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:10,439
finding joy they'll never really find

276
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,410
deep deep fulfillment in work or in life

277
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:16,559
they'll just just walk through life and

278
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,620
it'll G just it's fine how's your job

279
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,899
it's fine the same is yesterday how's

280
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,149
your relationship it's fine like that's

281
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,559
that's the best-case scenario which

282
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,329
leads me to the the fourth point which

283
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,540
is environment which is we're taking

284
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:32,550
this amazing group of young fantastic

285
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,740
kids would just dealt a bad hand it's no

286
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,689
fault of their own and we put them in

287
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,850
corporate environments that care more

288
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:41,069
about the numbers than they do about the

289
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,500
kids they care more about the short-term

290
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:46,740
gains than the long-term life of this

291
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,790
young human being we care more about the

292
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,779
year than the lifetime right and so we

293
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,429
are putting them in corporate

294
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,019
environments that aren't helping them

295
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:56,429
build their confidence that aren't

296
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,620
helping them learn the skills of

297
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:00,749
cooperation that aren't helping them

298
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,420
overcome the challenges of a digital

299
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:07,649
world and finding more balance that

300
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,029
isn't helping them overcome the need to

301
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,129
have instant gratification and teach

302
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,139
them the joys and impact and the

303
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,250
fulfilment you get from working hard

304
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,380
over on something for a long time

305
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,470
cannot be done in a month or even in a

306
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,640
year and so with thrusting to them them

307
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,840
in corporate environments in the worst

308
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,300
part about it is they think it's them

309
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,250
they blame themselves they can't they

310
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,170
think it's them who can't deal and so it

311
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,210
makes it all worse it's not I'm here to

312
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,710
tell them it's not them it's the

313
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,230
corporations it's the corporate

314
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,840
environment it's the total lack of good

315
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,330
leadership in our world today that is

316
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,400
making them feel the way they do they

317
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,660
would dealt a bad hand in it and I hate

318
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,590
to say it but it's the company's

319
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,450
responsibility

320
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,360
sucks to be you like we have no choice

321
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,950
right this is what we got and I wish

322
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,780
that society and their parents did a

323
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,430
better job they didn't so we're gonna

324
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,650
we're getting them in our companies and

325
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,630
we now have to pick up the slack we have

326
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,910
to work extra hard to figure out the

327
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,670
ways that we build their confidence we

328
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,010
have to work extra hard to find ways to

329
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,700
teach them social the social skills that

330
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,070
they're missing out on

331
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,980
there should be no cell phones and

332
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,300
conference rooms none zero and I don't

333
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,280
mean the kind of like sitting outside

334
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,360
waiting to text I mean like when you're

335
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,370
sitting and waiting for a meeting to

336
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,330
start nobody go this is what we all do

337
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,060
we all sit here and wait for the meeting

338
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,410
to start meaning starting ok we start

339
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,850
the meeting no that's not how

340
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,130
relationships are formed remember we

341
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,850
talked about it's the little things

342
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,460
relationships are formed this way we're

343
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,570
waiting for a meeting to start we go

344
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,550
how's your dad I heard he's in hospital

345
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,320
oh he's really good thanks for asking

346
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,240
he's actually at home now oh I'm really

347
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,280
glad it was really amazing I know it was

348
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,830
really scary girl that's how you form

349
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,960
relationships hey did you ever get that

350
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,400
report on oh my god no I didn't I'll

351
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,030
help you out I've totally are can I help

352
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,150
you out with that

353
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,580
really that's how trust forms trust

354
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,980
doesn't form at an event in a day even

355
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,360
bad times don't form trust immediately

356
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,610
it's the slow steady consistency and we

357
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,400
have to create mechanisms where we allow

358
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,960
for those little innocuous interactions

359
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,080
to happen but when we allow cell phones

360
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,730
and company mist okay have the meeting

361
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,930
and then my favorite is like when

362
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,380
there's a cell phone there and you go

363
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,380
like this you go

364
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:24,970
it rings and go I'm not gonna answer

365
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,900
that mr. magnanimous you know when

366
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,110
you're out for dinner with your friends

367
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,010
like I do this with my friends when

368
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,590
we're going out for dinner and we're

369
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,510
leaving together we'll leave our cell

370
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,590
phones at home who are we calling maybe

371
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,930
one of us will bring the phone in case

372
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,260
we need to call an uber or take a

373
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,670
picture of our meal

374
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:49,000
bang come on I'm not I'm an idealist but

375
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,650
I'm not insane I don't even I mean it

376
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,190
looked really good

377
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,570
we'll take one phone and so it's like an

378
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,970
alcoholic the reason you take the

379
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,380
alcohol out of the house is because we

380
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,850
cannot trust our willpower we're just

381
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,550
not strong enough but when you remove

382
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,170
the temptation it actually makes it a

383
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,700
lot easier and so when you just say

384
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,990
don't check your phone people literally

385
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,040
will go like this and somebody would go

386
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,220
to the bathroom and what's the first

387
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,270
thing we do because I wouldn't want to

388
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,710
look around the restaurant for a minute

389
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,070
and a half you know but if you don't

390
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:21,100
have the phone you just kind of enjoy

391
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,660
the world and that's where ideas happen

392
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,650
the constant constant constant

393
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,810
engagement is not where you have

394
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,670
innovation and ideas ideas happen when

395
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,740
our minds wander we go and you see

396
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,590
something on I bet they could do that

397
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,720
that's called innovation right but we're

398
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,900
taking away all those little moments

399
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,000
right

400
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,590
you should not end none of us none of us

401
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,550
should charge our phones by our beds we

402
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,950
should be charging our phones in the

403
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,120
living rooms right remove the temptation

404
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,770
you wake up in the middle of night cause

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,170
you can't sleep you won't check your

406
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,900
phone which makes it worse but if it's

407
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,250
in the living room it's relaxed it's

408
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,180
fine hiya

409
00:14:51,250 --> 00:15:01,470
but it's my alarm clock fine alarm clock

410
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,470
they cost $8 I'll buy you in a while
