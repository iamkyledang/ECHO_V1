1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,460
Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Tim Minchin

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:10,460
(applause)

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,640
In darker days I did a corporate gig at a
conference for this big company who made and

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,460
sold accounting software in a bid, I presumed,
to inspire their salespeople to greater heights.

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,469
They'd forked out 12 grand for an inspirational
speaker who was this extreme sports guy who

6
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,769
had had a couple of his limbs frozen off when
he got stuck on a ledge on some mountain.

7
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,719
It was weird.

8
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,070
Software salespeople I think need to hear
from someone who has had a long successful

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,210
career in software sales not from an overly
optimistic ex-mountaineer.

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,379
Some poor guy who had arrived in the morning hoping to learn about sales techniques ended

11
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:05,170
up going home worried about the blood flow
to his extremities. It's not inspirational,

12
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,970
it's confusing. And if the mountain was meant
to be a symbol of life's challenges and the

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,160
loss of limbs a metaphor for sacrifice, the
software guy is not going to get it, is he?

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,590
Because he didn't do an Arts degree, did
he? He should have.

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,700
Arts degrees are awesome and they help you
find meaning where there is none. And let

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,640
me assure you there is none. Don't go looking
for it. Searching for meaning is like searching

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,170
for a rhymes scheme in a cookbook. You won't find it and it will bugger up your soufflé.

18
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,170
If you didn't like that metaphor you won't
like the rest of it.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,870
Point being I'm not an inspirational speaker.
Iíve never ever lost a limb on a mountainside

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,060
metaphorically or otherwise and I'm certainly
not going to give career advice because, well

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,780
I've never really had what most would consider a job. However I have had large groups of

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,540
people listening to what I say for quite a
few years now and itís given me an inflated

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,890
sense of self importance.

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,890
So I will now, at the ripe old age of 37-point-nine, bestow upon you nine life lessons to echo

25
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,480
of course the nine lessons of carols of the
traditional Christmas service, which is also

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,530
pretty obscure.

27
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,249
You might find some of this stuff inspiring.
You will definitely find some of it boring

28
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:27,499
and you will definitely forget all of it within
a week. And be warned there will be lots of

29
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:33,650
similes and obscure aphorisms which start
well but end up making no sense. So listen

30
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,790
up or you'll get lost like a blind man clapping
in a pharmacy trying to echo-locate the

31
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,709
contact lens fluid.

32
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,319
(audience laughs) - Looking for my old poetry
teacher.

33
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,849
Here we go, ready?

34
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,700
One: You don't have to have a dream. Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams.

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,389
Fine if you have something you've always
wanted to do, dreamed of, like in your heart,

36
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,510
go for it. After all it's something to do
with your time, chasing a dream. And if it's

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,999
a big enough one it'll take you most of your
life to achieve so by the time you get to

38
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:14,180
it and are staring into the abyss of the meaningless of your achievement you'll be almost dead

39
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,459
so it won't matter.

40
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,209
I never really had one of these dreams and
so I advocate passionate, dedication to the

41
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,299
pursuit of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on

42
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,810
whatever is in front of you. You never know
where you might end up. Just be aware the

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,180
next worthy pursuit will probably appear in
your periphery, which is why you should be

44
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,599
careful of long-term dreams. If you focus
too far in front of you you won't see the

45
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:47,599
shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right?
Good! Advice metaphor - look at me go.

46
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:53,819
Two: Don't seek happiness. Happiness is like
an orgasm. If you think about it too much

47
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:00,819
it goes away. (audience laughs) Keep busy
and aim to make someone else happy and you

48
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,599
might find you get some as a side effect.
We didn't evolve to be constantly content.

49
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,540
Contented Homo erectus got eaten before passing on their genes.

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Three: Remember it's all luck. You are lucky
to be here. You are incalculably lucky to

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,190
be born and incredibly lucky to be brought
up by a nice family who encouraged you to

52
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,020
go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible
family that's unlucky and you have my sympathy

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,949
but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen
to be made of the sort of DNA that went on

54
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,389
to make the sort of brain which when placed
in a horrible child environment would make

55
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,789
decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging

56
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,780
yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were
lucky. You didn't create the bit of you that

57
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,039
dragged you up. They're not even your shoelaces.

58
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,949
I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever
dubious achievements I've achieved but I

59
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:03,250
didn't make the bit of me that works hard
any more than I made the bit of me that ate

60
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,259
too many burgers instead of attending lectures when I was here at UWA. Understanding that

61
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:13,460
you can't truly take credit for your successes
nor truly blame others for their failures

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,370
will humble you and make you more compassionate. Empathy is intuitive. It is also something

63
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,889
you can work on intellectually.

64
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:27,889
Four: Exercise. I'm sorry you pasty, pale,
smoking philosophy grads arching your eyebrows

65
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,780
into a Cartesian curve as you watch the human
movement mob winding their way through the

66
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,629
miniature traffic cones of their existence.
You are wrong and they are right. Well you're

67
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,759
half right. You think therefore you are but
also you jog therefore you sleep therefore

68
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,419
you're not overwhelmed by existential angst.
You can't be can't and you don't want to

69
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:52,270
be. Play a sport. Do yoga, pump iron, and
run, whatever but take care of your body,

70
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,460
you're going to need it. Most of you mob
are going to live to nearly 100 and even the

71
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,939
poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth
that most humans throughout history could

72
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,639
not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious
life ahead of you is going to make you depressed.

73
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,550
(audience laughs) But don't despair. There
is correlation between depression and exercise.

74
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,030
Do it! Run, my beautiful intellectuals run.

75
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:23,030
Five: Be hard on your opinions. A famous bon mot asserts opinions are like assholes in

76
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,069
that everyone has one. There is great wisdom
in this but I would add that opinions differ

77
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,189
significantly from assholes in that yours
should be constantly and thoroughly examined.

78
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:41,189
(audience laughs) I used to do exams in here
(audience laughs) - It's revenge.

79
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:53,169
We must think critically and not just about
the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs.

80
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,719
Take them out onto the verandah and hit them with a cricket bat. Be intellectually rigorous.

81
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:04,360
Identify your biases, your prejudices, your
privileges. Most of society is kept alive

82
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,379
by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend
to generate false dichotomies and then try

83
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:15,400
to argue one point using two entirely different
sets of assumptions. Like two tennis players

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,509
trying to win a match by hitting beautifully
executed shots from either end of separate

85
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,879
tennis courts.

86
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,210
By the way, while I have science and arts
graduates in front of me please don't make

87
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,240
the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences
are at odds with one another. That is a recent,

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,379
stupid and damaging idea. You donít have
to be unscientific to make beautiful art,

89
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:41,319
to write beautiful things. If you need proof
- Twain, Douglas Adams, Vonnegut, McEwan,

90
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,360
Sagan and Shakespeare, Dickens for a start.
You don't need to be superstitious to be

91
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,680
a poet. You don't need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You

92
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,180
don't have to claim a soul to promote compassion. Science is not a body of knowledge nor a belief

93
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,310
system it's just a term which describes human kinds' incremental acquisition of understanding

94
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,409
through observation. Science is awesome! The arts and sciences need to work together to

95
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,030
improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians including our new

96
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,289
PM and my distant cousin Nick Minchin believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming

97
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:22,240
is controversial is a powerful indicator of
the extent of our failure to communicate.

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,590
The fact that 30 percent of the people just
bristled is further evidence still. (audience

99
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,289
laughs) The fact that that bristling is more
to do with politics than science is even more

100
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,169
despairing.

101
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:39,169
Six: Be a teacher! Please! Please! Please
be a teacher. Teachers are the most admirable

102
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,610
and important people in the world. You don't
have to do it forever but if you're in doubt

103
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,360
about what to do be an amazing teacher. Just
for your 20s be a teacher. Be a primary school

104
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,240
teacher. Especially if you're a bloke. We
need male primary school teachers. Even if

105
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,510
you're not a teacher, be a teacher. Share
your ideas. Don't take for granted your education.

106
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,220
Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.

107
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,670
Seven: Define yourself by what you love. I
found myself doing this thing a bit recently

108
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,430
where if someone asks me what sort of music I like I say. Well I don't listen to the

109
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,209
radio because pop song lyrics annoy me,
or if someone asks me what food I like I say,

110
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:23,370
I think truffle oil is overused and slightly
obnoxious. And I see it all the time online

111
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,070
- people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists

112
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,760
or the Liberal Party.

113
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,149
We have a tendency to define ourselves in
opposition to stuff. As a comedian I make

114
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,970
my living out of it. But try to also express
your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative

115
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,940
and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank you cards and give standing ovations.

116
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,700
Be pro stuff not just anti stuff.

117
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,620
Eight: Respect people with less power than
you. I have in the past made important decisions

118
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,250
about people I work with agents and producers - big decisions based largely on how they

119
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,690
treat the wait staff in the restaurants we're
having the meeting in. I don't care if you're

120
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,529
the most powerful cat in the room, I will
judge you on how you treat the least powerful.

121
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,430
So there!

122
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,149
Nine: Finally, don't rush. You don't need
to know what you're going to do with the

123
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:23,760
rest of your life. I'm not saying sit around
smoking cones all day but also don't panic!

124
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,750
Most people I know who were sure of their
career path at 20 are having mid-life crises

125
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,300
now.

126
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,889
I said at the beginning of this ramble, which
is already three-and-a-half minutes long,

127
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,589
life is meaningless. It was not a flippant
assertion. I think itís absurd the idea of

128
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:44,339
seeking meaning in the set of circumstances
that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years

129
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,279
worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans
to think the universe has a purpose for them.

130
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:56,449
However I'm no nihilist. I'm not even a
cynic. I am actually rather romantic and hereís

131
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:03,449
my idea of romance: you will soon be dead.
Life will sometimes seem long and tough and

132
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,980
God it's tiring. And you will sometimes be
happy and sometimes sad and then you'll be

133
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,490
old and then youíll be dead. There is only
one sensible thing to do with this empty existence

134
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,490
and that is fill it. Not fillet. Fill it.
And in my opinion, until I change it, life

135
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,899
is best filled by learning as much as you
can about as much as you can. Taking pride

136
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:36,180
in whatever you're doing. Having compassion, sharing ideas, running, being enthusiastic

137
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,110
and then there's love and travel and wine
and sex and art and kids and giving and mountain

138
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,889
climbing, but you know all that stuff already.
Itís an incredibly exciting thing this one

139
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:54,889
meaningless life of yours. Good luck and thank you for indulging me.
