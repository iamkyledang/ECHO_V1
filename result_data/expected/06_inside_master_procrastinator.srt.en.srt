00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,968
About a year ago, I asked
my YouTube followers to play

3
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:26,491
a simple computer programming puzzle
that I made with a buddy.

4
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,928
The object of the puzzle
was to get your car across the maze

5
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:32,028
by arranging these code blocks

6
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:34,678
that represent typical
computer programming operations,

7
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:37,348
such as if-else statements
and while loops.

8
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,589
Once you thought you
had a good code, you would hit Run,

9
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:44,509
and your car would move based on
the commands you had in the program.

10
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:48,553
I asked my YouTube followers to play it
because I said I wanted to prove

11
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:51,290
that anyone from any background
could learn to code.

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,980
Fifty thousand of them took the challenge
and attempted the puzzle.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,561
But the truth was

14
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:01,741
that I didn't actually care about proving
that anyone could learn to code.

15
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,829
What they didn't know
is that we actually randomly served up

16
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,028
two slightly different
versions of the puzzle.

17
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,109
In one version, if you hit Run
and you weren't successful,

18
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,219
you didn't lose any
of your starting 200 points.

19
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:15,509
We showed you this message.

20
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,519
[Please try again.]

21
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,949
However, in the other version,

22
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:20,679
if you hit Run and again
you weren't successful,

23
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:23,119
we showed this slightly different message,

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,968
stating that you lost five points
from your starting 200 points.

25
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,519
That was the only difference.

26
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,389
In one version, if you failed,

27
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:33,739
we simply took away
five no-value-in-the-real-world,

28
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,139
no-one-will-ever-see-these,

29
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:37,659
completely meaningless,
fake internet points.

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,879
(Laughter)

31
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,990
That minor difference
is crucial to keep in mind

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,800
for the results I'm about to show you
from the 50,000 data points we collected.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,689
For those who were penalized
for failed attempts,

34
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,809
their success rate was around 52%.

35
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,769
For those who were not penalized,
their success rate was 68%.

36
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,378
That statistically significant delta
of 16% was really surprising

37
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:05,188
and almost seemed too hard to believe

38
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,618
until we looked at another piece
of data that we collected,

39
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,278
which was attempts to solve
before finding success.

40
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,968
It's shown in orange right here.

41
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,428
So, those who didn't see failing
in a negative light

42
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:19,168
nearly had two and a half times
more attempts to solve the puzzle.

43
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:23,450
As a result, naturally, they saw
more success and therefore learned more.

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,639
So if you think about that
and sort of unpack these results,

45
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,469
the trick to learning more
and having more success

46
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,509
is finding the right way
to frame the learning process.

47
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:35,059
And this observation
seemed really profound to me.

48
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:38,669
It made me wonder, What if you just frame
the learning process in such a way

49
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,499
that you did not concern
yourself with failure,

50
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,819
how much more successful could you be,
how much more could you learn?

51
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,618
The next thought
was that if this is a real effect,

52
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:50,338
clearly there must be some evidence
for this in real life.

53
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,808
It made me think of toddlers.

54
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:54,468
That's my boy; I helped make that.

55
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,668
(Laughter)

56
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:58,948
They are constantly trying new things,

57
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:01,558
and they certainly
aren't concerned with failure.

58
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,898
When my son learned to walk,

59
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:06,089
he didn't think about how dumb
he might look if he fell down,

60
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,659
and as his parents, we didn't punish him
if he wasn't successful either.

61
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,810
The focus was always on the end goal,
and we celebrated the successes with him.

62
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,449
As a result of constantly
failing and trying

63
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,339
and discovering new things
during that phase of our life,

64
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:24,851
we discover so many more
new capabilities within ourselves,

65
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,780
and it's not even close
to any other time in our life.

66
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,220
But maybe using a toddler
is sort of cheating

67
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,908
because their brains
are different than ours.

68
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,998
To make the case that perhaps
they aren't that different than us,

69
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:42,048
I'd like to tell you about a plumber
I first met when I was eight years old.

70
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,119
He was Italian.

71
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,299
(Power up sound effect)

72
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,339
(Laughter)

73
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:52,150
When Super Mario Bros. came out,
my friends and I became obsessed -

74
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,820
like, we wanted to get to the castle
and rescue the beautiful Princess Peach

75
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,820
from the evil Bowser.

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,629
We'd get to school and ask each other,

77
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,488
"Dude, what level did you make it to?
Did you pass the game?"

78
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:05,878
We never asked each other about details on
all the different ways we might have died.

79
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,458
When it comes to games like this,

80
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,978
no one ever picks up the controller
for the first time

81
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,933
and then after jumping into a pit thinks,

82
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,933
"I am so ashamed;
that was such a failure,"

83
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,838
and they never want to try again, right?

84
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,468
What really happens is they think,
"I've got to remember there's a pit there;

85
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,279
next time, I'm going to come out
with a little more speed

86
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,368
and jump a bit later."

87
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:26,238
The focus and the obsession
is about beating the game,

88
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:29,959
not how dumb you might look
if you get hit by a sliding green shell.

89
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,608
And as a direct result of that attitude

90
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:35,958
of learning from but not being
focused on the failures,

91
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,879
we got really good, and we learned a ton
in a very short amount of time.

92
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,880
We were the right side of this graph.

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,040
This is what I call
the Super Mario Effect:

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,470
focusing on the princess and not the pits
to stick with a task and to learn more.

95
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,510
This caused me to reflect and realize
that there were lots of other examples

96
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,330
from my own personal experience
where this attitude of life gamification,

97
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:02,720
this Super Mario Effect led to more
success and therefore more learning.

98
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,320
I have a science YouTube channel

99
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,610
where I will sometimes use
my engineering skills

100
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,100
to build things such as
the world's largest Super Soaker

101
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,714
or the Guinness World Record
world's largest Nerf gun.

102
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:18,304
(Video) (Screaming)

103
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,654
(Audience) (Laughter)

104
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,489
(On stage) Mark Rober:
Or maybe this snowball machine gun.

105
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,489
(Video) MR: Ha, ha, ha. Yes!

106
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,684
(On stage) MR: Fashioned
from a leaf blower.

107
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:32,634
(Audience) (Laughter)

108
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:33,714
That's my niece.

109
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,540
Those are my nephews.

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,718
(Laughter)

111
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,200
I haven't quite figured it out,

112
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,670
but when it comes to me, their uncle,
they seem to have some trust issues.

113
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,680
(Laughter)

114
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:51,579
So, these builds usually take me
about two to three months,

115
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,269
but there was one
that took me three years.

116
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:58,740
Basically, I wanted to make a dartboard
where you could get a bullseye every time.

117
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,169
The idea was that if you throw a dart,
we could track it through the air,

118
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,878
and then we'd move the board
to sort of catch a bullseye.

119
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:05,898
(Laughter)

120
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:09,978
And so, once we did the math, we realized
that if we wanted to track the dart

121
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,900
for a typical, like, game of darts,
typical velocity,

122
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,210
we would basically have
to both track the dart and move the board

123
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,570
in the same amount of time
it takes for a human to blink once.

124
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,740
No big deal, right?

125
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,890
I'm not going to bore you
with all the details

126
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,469
and the failures and the setbacks

127
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,929
from a lot of metaphorical
sliding green shells

128
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,308
and those pesky Hammerhead Bros,

129
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,379
but eventually we figured out

130
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,479
it would take something
that looks like this,

131
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,858
which is six stepper motors
and motion controllers,

132
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:39,258
a Vicon motion capture system
with six cameras,

133
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,308
and just a ton of tweaking
and rewriting the code.

134
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,310
But finally, eventually, we arrived here.

135
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:52,504
(Applause)

136
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,960
What's interesting is
when I look back on that process,

137
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,809
like, I can honestly say
my attitude towards that

138
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:08,848
was the same attitude I had toward,
like, rescuing the princess from Bowser.

139
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:12,738
Like, of course, each failure
and setback sucked; it stung.

140
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:16,040
But it was no different
than falling in that pit on Level 8-1,

141
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,999
and you're like, "Argh,"
and you got to go back and try again.

142
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:22,308
It was always like, "OK, that sucked,
but what did we learn from that?

143
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,978
What can we do next for it?
Let's hit it again."

144
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,028
And this concept of life gamification

145
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,808
is more than just, like,
"Have a positive attitude"

146
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,298
or "Never give up"

147
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,590
because those sort of imply

148
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,010
you're having to endure
against your true desire to quit.

149
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,820
I feel like when you frame a challenge
or a learning process

150
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,090
in the way I'm describing,

151
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,630
you actually want to do it.

152
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,570
It feels natural to ignore
the failures and try again,

153
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,360
in the same way a toddler will want
to get up and try and walk again

154
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,588
or in the same way you want
to keep playing Super Mario Bros.

155
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:57,340
or in the same way the group on the right
had a desire to stick with that puzzle

156
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,318
two and a half times longer.

157
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,098
They weren't getting paid to do that.

158
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,438
Nobody was forcing them or watching them.

159
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,688
It was just them on their computer,
alone in their house.

160
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:10,339
Their outlook made it so they
wanted to keep trying and learning.

161
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,198
The icing on the cake for the dartboard

162
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:15,388
was I took it on Jimmy Kimmel
and challenged him to a game of darts.

163
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,669
I'll just set this clip up
by saying two things.

164
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,729
The first is we also
had a mode on the board

165
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,779
where if your buddy had it
and threw a dart,

166
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,460
the board would move the other way.

167
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,920
(Laughter)

168
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,500
And the second is that we couldn't get
this thing working during rehearsal,

169
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,677
and it was just barely
kind of creeping along.

170
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,297
I get up to stand in the elevator,

171
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,298
which is the door that moves up
before you go down out on stage.

172
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,638
I look to the right,
all six cameras had failed.

173
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,688
So my buddy John is feverishly,
like, restarting all the cameras

174
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,928
as I'm going out onto stage knowing this,
and there's, like, four things and bits,

175
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:50,398
and I work up to the dartboard
as the sort of grand finale.

176
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,598
So just keep that in mind
as this clip starts.

177
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,518
Like, that's where my headspace is.

178
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,960
Three freaking years,
and it comes down to this moment.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,520
(Video) MR: What you're going to do
is give this dart to your buddy,

180
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,492
and you're going to challenge him
just to, like, hit the board.

181
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:06,972
Jimmy Kimmel: Just try
to hit the board. OK. Alright.

182
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,740
(Laughter)

183
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,319
MR: Alright, hot shot. Double or nothing?

184
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,539
JK: Alright, yeah, yeah, alright. Ready?

185
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:17,416
(Laughter)

186
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,434
OK.

187
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,963
MR: Alright. And so, then I step up here.
JK: This does this automatically?

188
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,868
MR: That's right.
JK: And you built this?

189
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,568
MR: That's right. I step up.

190
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:27,238
Here we go.

191
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,243
(Cheers) (Applause)

192
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,561
(On stage) MR: Fake it till you make it.

193
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,561
(Laughter)

194
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,229
I will say, in all of our testing,

195
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,559
literally, we never
had a dead-center bullseye

196
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,189
as much as that one right there.

197
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,064
So, like, after that,
I haven't even touched the board since.

198
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,634
I'm like, "I'm so done with it."

199
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:46,694
(Laughter)

200
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:51,739
And I really believe that if you reframe,
like, the challenges,

201
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,228
it can make all the difference.

202
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,238
I have a simple thought experiment
to sort of showcase this.

203
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,528
Let's say I gave you a test

204
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:00,148
and it had instructions on it
that you would carry out,

205
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:03,059
and to do that, it had
sort of buttons like this.

206
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,649
And the instructions would say something
like, "Push button 3 for 5 seconds"

207
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,541
and then, "Push button 6 for 1 second,"

208
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,281
then, "Push buttons 3 and 5
for 6 seconds," and so on.

209
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,278
And unless you carried out
the instructions on page one exactly,

210
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,998
you couldn't see
the other 32 pages of the test.

211
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:20,560
How much would I have to pay you
to take that test for an hour?

212
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,629
Now suppose I change
the word "test" here to "game,"

213
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,581
and I rotated this,

214
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,431
and for the input device,
I shrunk the buttons and moved them here,

215
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,438
and I gave it a cool paint job

216
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:34,838
and maybe different button styles.

217
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:36,388
And then instead of using words,

218
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:40,231
I represented the tasks you needed
to accomplish visually like this.

219
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,690
Note the output is the exact same:

220
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,308
you have to push these buttons
in a very specific manner

221
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:49,298
to move on to the next page
or level, as it were.

222
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,508
Now picture it's 1986.

223
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:55,549
How much would you pay me
to take this test just for an hour?

224
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:59,571
If you have a very bad imagination,
here's a hint to the right answer.

225
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,675
I know. I was there.

226
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,835
(Video) Boy: Nintendo!

227
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:03,841
(Crying)

228
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:06,057
Oh, Dad, thank you.

229
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,110
Thank you!

230
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,693
Dad: Don't come and hug me,
go play with it!

231
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:13,739
Boy: (Crying)

232
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,056
(Audience) (Laughter)

233
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:18,271
(On stage) MR: That has to be
the greatest YouTube clip of all time.

234
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,641
(Laughter)

235
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,048
So, as a science YouTuber,

236
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,628
sometimes I feel people
have framed the act of learning science

237
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,000
in a negative way.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,020
It's been taught poorly,
so it feels scary to them.

239
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,521
It feels something more like this.

240
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:35,231
And my approach is to take the same
physics lessons you might have hated

241
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:37,146
and to try and sort of trick you

242
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:40,746
into learning something
through something cool:

243
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:43,540
basically to go from this to this.

244
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,801
So for example, in this video,
I made a hot tub with liquefied sand.

245
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:53,851
And this is another one of my nephews
with unexplained trust issues.

246
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:54,901
(Laughter)

247
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,429
I explain in the video
that it's a fluidized bed,

248
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:00,689
and then we talk
about the principle of buoyancy

249
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,499
and how it makes the whole thing work,

250
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,789
and I use several examples,

251
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,819
like, you know, the blow-dryer
with a ping-pong ball like this.

252
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:11,531
I like to think my approach to science is
similar to Velociraptor hunting patterns.

253
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:16,510
So, I get people to come in with something
cool and amazing like the sand hot tub,

254
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,642
and then when they least expect it -

255
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:19,643
(Video) (Music)

256
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,864
(Growling)

257
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,204
Robert Muldoon: Clever girl.

258
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:27,335
(On stage) MR: Admittedly,
the analogy breaks down a little bit

259
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:28,605
right there at the end.

260
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:33,860
But by reframing the learning process
and focusing on the cool end goal,

261
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,659
the fear of failure
is often taken off the table,

262
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,858
and learning just comes more naturally.

263
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,138
I'll close with this thought.

264
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,408
Someone came up with this cartoon,
and I totally love it.

265
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:45,648
This is so true,

266
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:49,558
but often in life we tell ourselves
that the top version is what we want;

267
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,168
that's what we expect.

268
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,458
But then something happens.

269
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,358
Maybe it's a really bad grade on a test

270
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,838
or a meeting with a client
that goes horribly wrong.

271
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,443
Maybe it's a bad breakup.

272
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,973
Maybe we miss a wide-open shot.

273
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,128
Some kind of green shell hits you.

274
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:05,968
And so, at that first setback
or sign of failure, doubt creeps in.

275
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:09,076
We tell ourselves we're not good enough
or we're not smart enough.

276
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:13,538
And yet, if the bottom rectangle here
is a game where now your bikes crash

277
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,838
and you have to get your bike
across to the flag,

278
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,598
it's not, "Oh, I hit these rocks.
I'm just going to leave my bike here.

279
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,889
I'm not good enough,"
and you quit and walk away.

280
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,373
You see that flag to the right,

281
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,473
and you're like,
"Nah, what did I just learn?

282
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,928
OK, next time, I'm going
to come out with more speed

283
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,828
and lift the front of my bike up."

284
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:31,033
You want to try it again.

285
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,233
You're immediately excited
to go for it again.

286
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,508
We sort of tell ourselves

287
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:37,218
we want our life's challenges
to look like the top one,

288
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,378
but that's boring.

289
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:41,321
If that were a real video game
or a book or a movie

290
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,851
and that went out to the market,

291
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,441
it would be a total failure.

292
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:45,448
Nobody would buy it.

293
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:48,088
Where's the risk and the reward?
Where's the challenge?

294
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,118
There's no feeling of satisfaction.

295
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:55,000
The bottom picture is real life,
and that's not a bug, that's a feature.

296
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:58,239
Think about anything
that means anything to you in life,

297
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,619
whether it's a degree,

298
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,644
a relationship with a friend
or someone in your family,

299
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,394
maybe a professional accomplishment.

300
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:08,098
I can guarantee you it came
from something that looks like the bottom

301
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,448
and not the top:

302
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,309
failing and failing and failing
and eventually succeeding

303
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,208
to the point that it now holds value,

304
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:20,488
just like the most meaningful high-fives
of my adolescence were those when I said,

305
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,480
"Dude, I finally beat Bowser last night."

306
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:27,343
I feel like a lot
of the successes in my life

307
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:29,293
have come down to the Super Mario Effect,

308
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,136
and while framing challenges
like this has worked for me,

309
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,986
of course, results may vary.

310
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:35,619
Everyone is going to be different,

311
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:39,239
and I don't know exactly what it
looks like for you to take this principle

312
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,858
and map it into your life.

313
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:43,519
But if we got these very real results

314
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,969
from a very different cross-section
of very unique people,

315
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,511
clearly I'm not alone.

316
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:51,081
There's some universal
principle at play here.

317
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,208
By shifting your focus to the princess

318
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,698
and treating your life's challenges
like video games,

319
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,498
you can trick your brain
and actually learn more

320
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,968
and see more success.

321
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:01,021
Thank you.

322
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,031
(Applause)
