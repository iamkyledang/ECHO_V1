00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,065
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:16,625
Two year ago, my life changed forever.

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,261
My wife Kelsey and I

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,033
welcomed our daughter Lela
into the world.

6
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,456
Now, becoming a parent
is an amazing experience.

7
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,704
Your whole world changes over night.

8
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:33,285
And all of your priorities
change immediately.

9
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:39,294
So fast that it makes it really difficult
to process sometimes.

10
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,547
Now, you also have to learn
a tremendous amount about being a parent

11
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,820
like, for example,
how to dress your child.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,954
(Laughter)

13
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,091
This was new to me.

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,844
This is an actual outfit, 
I thought this was a good idea.

15
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:59,558
And even Lela knows
that it's not a good idea. (Laughter)

16
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,409
So there is so much to learn and
so much craziness all at once.

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,533
And to add to the craziness, 
Kelsey and I both work from home,

18
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,223
we're entrepreneurs,
we run our own businesses.

19
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:16,992
So, Kelsey develops courses
online for yoga teachers.

20
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,333
I'm an author.

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,782
And so, I'm working from home,
Kelsey's working from home.

22
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,901
We have an infant
and we're trying to make sure

23
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,725
that everything gets done
that needs done.

24
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:31,107
And life is really, really busy.

25
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,718
And a couple of weeks
into this amazing experience,

26
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:40,247
when the sleep deprivation
really kicked in,

27
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,299
like around week eight,

28
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,732
I had this thought,
and it was the same thought

29
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:49,773
that parents across the ages,
internationally,

30
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,467
everybody has had this thought,
which is:

31
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:58,054
I am never going to have
free time ever again.

32
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:59,183
(Laughter)

33
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,403
Somebody said it's true.

34
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,214
It's not exactly true,

35
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:09,866
but it feels really, really true
in that moment.

36
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,075
And this was really
disconcerning to me,

37
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,484
because one of the things that I enjoy

38
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:19,428
more than anything else
is learning new things.

39
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:22,261
Getting curious about something
and diving in

40
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,164
and fiddling around and 
learning through trial and error.

41
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:28,440
And eventually becoming pretty good
at something.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,336
And without this free time,

43
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:36,405
I didn't know how I was ever 
going to do that ever again.

44
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,877
And so, I'm a big geek,

45
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:42,070
I want to keep learning things,
I want to keep growing.

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,087
And so what I've decided to do was,

47
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,784
go to the library,
and go to the bookstore,

48
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,922
and look at what research says about

49
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:53,523
how we learn and how we learn quickly.

50
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,834
And I read a bunch of books,
I read a bunch of websites.

51
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,091
And tried to answer this question,

52
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,040
how long does it take
to acquire a new skill?

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,117
You know what I found?

54
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:09,438
10,000 hours!

55
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,200
Anybody ever heard this?

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,134
It takes 10,000 hours.
If you want to learn something new,

57
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,574
if you want to be good at it,

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,934
it's going to take 10,000 hours
to get there.

59
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:21,455
And I read this in book after book,
in website after website.

60
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:28,421
And my mental experience
of reading all of this stuff was like:

61
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,799
No!!

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,539
I don't have time!
I don't have 10,000 hours.

63
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,088
I am never going to be able
to learn anything new.

64
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:42,421
Ever again.
(Laughter)

65
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,479
But that's not true.

66
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,559
So, 10,000 hours, just to give you
a rough order of magnitude,

67
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:52,422
10,000 hours is a full-time job
for five years.

68
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,008
That's a long time.

69
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,364
And we've all had the experience
of learning something new,

70
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:00,439
and it didn't take us anywhere
close to that amount of time, right?

71
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,505
So, what's up? There's something
kinda funky going on here.

72
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:07,078
What the research says and what we expect,
and have experiences,

73
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,416
they don't match up.

74
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,993
And what I found, here's the wrinkle:

75
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:19,722
The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies
of expert-level performance.

76
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:22,228
There's a professor
at Florida State University,

77
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,226
his name is K. Anders Ericsson.

78
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,725
He is the originator
of the 10,00 hour rule.

79
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,261
And where that came from is,
he studied professional athletes,

80
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:35,763
world class musicians,
chess grand masters.

81
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:40,775
All of this ultra competitive folks
in ultra-high performing fields.

82
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:43,751
And he tried to figure out
how long does it take

83
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,811
to get to the top
of those kinds of fields.

84
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,668
And what he found is,
the more deliberate practice,

85
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,194
the more time
that those individuals spend

86
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:55,304
practicing the elements
of whatever it is that they do,

87
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,246
the more time you spend,
the better you get.

88
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,165
And the folks at the tippy top
of their fields

89
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:05,101
put in around 10,000 hours of practice.

90
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:09,442
Now, we were talking about the game
of telephone a little bit earlier.

91
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,236
Here's what happened:

92
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,458
an author by the name
of Malcolm Gladwell

93
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,901
wrote a book in 2007 called
"Outliers: The Story of Success",

94
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,592
and the central piece of that book
was the 10,000 hour rule.

95
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,642
Practice a lot, practice well,
and you will do extremely well,

96
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,367
you will reach the top of your field.

97
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,472
So, the message,

98
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,455
what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is,

99
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:37,425
it takes 10,000 hours to get
at the top of an ultra competitive field

100
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,857
in a very narrow subject,
that's what that means.

101
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:45,294
But here's what happened:
ever since Outliers came out,

102
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,449
immediately came out,
reached the top of best seller lists,

103
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,056
stayed there for three solid months.

104
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:54,171
All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule
was everywhere.

105
00:05:54,171 --> 00:06:00,022
And a society-wide game of telephone
started to be played.

106
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:04,955
So this message, it takes 10,000 hours
to reach the top of an ultra competitive field,

107
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:09,927
became, it takes 10,000 hours
to become an expert at something,

108
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,366
which became,

109
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:15,667
it takes 10,000 hours to become
good at something,

110
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,192
which became,

111
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:21,455
it takes 10,000 hours
to learn something.

112
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:25,337
But that last statement,
it takes 10,000 hours to learn something,

113
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:28,600
is not true.
It's not true.

114
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,346
So, what the research actually says --

115
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,217
I spent a lot of time here
at the CSU library

116
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,523
in the cognitive psychology stacks
'cause I'm a geek.

117
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:44,216
And when you actually look
at the studies of skill acquisition,

118
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:48,039
you see over and over
a graph like this.

119
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,694
Now, researchers,
whether they're studying a motor skill,

120
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,328
something you do physically
or a mental skill,

121
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,174
they like to study things
that they can time.

122
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,185
'Cause you can quantify that, right?

123
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,452
So, they'll give research participants
a little task,

124
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,156
something that requires
physical arrangement,

125
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:08,925
or something that requires
learning a little mental trick,

126
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:13,357
and they'll time how long a participant
takes to complete the skill.

127
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,095
And here's what this graph says,
when you start --

128
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:20,398
so when researchers gave participants
a task, it took them a really long time,

129
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,053
'cause it was new
and they were horrible.

130
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:26,651
With a little bit of practice,
they get better and better and better.

131
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:30,632
And that early part of practice
is really, really efficient.

132
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:36,021
People get good at things
with just a little bit of practice.

133
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,663
Now, what's interesting to note is that,

134
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,869
for skills that we want to learn
for ourselves,

135
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,736
we don't care so much about time,
right?

136
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:49,283
We just care about how good we are,
whatever good happens to mean.

137
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:54,943
So if we relabel performance time
to how good you are,

138
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:59,346
the graph flips, and you get
his famous and widely known,

139
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,274
this is the learning curve.

140
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,852
And the story of the learning curve
is when you start,

141
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,567
you're grossly incompetent
and you know it, right?

142
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,635
(Laughter)

143
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:11,997
With a little bit of practice,
you get really good, really quick.

144
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,715
So that early level of improvement
is really fast.

145
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,630
And then at a certain point
you reach a plateau,

146
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,960
and the subsequent games
become much harder to get,

147
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,659
they take more time to get.

148
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,620
Now, my question is,
I want that, right?

149
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,605
How long does it take
from starting something

150
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:35,265
and being grossly incompetent
and knowing it

151
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,575
to being reasonably good?

152
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:42,329
In hopefully, as short a period of time
as possible.

153
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,539
So, how long does that take?

154
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,518
Here's what my research says: 20 hours.

155
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:53,163
That's it.
You can go from knowing nothing

156
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,739
about any skill that you can think of.

157
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,175
Want to learn a language?
Want to learn how to draw?

158
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,294
Want to learn how to juggle
flaming chainsaws?

159
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,320
(Laughter)

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,532
If you put 20 hours of focused
deliberate practice into that thing,

161
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,964
you will be astounded.

162
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,135
Astounded at how good you are.

163
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,645
20 hours is doable,

164
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:19,956
that's about 45 minutes a day
for about a month.

165
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,066
Even skipping a couple days,
here and there.

166
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:25,221
20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate.

167
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:28,100
Now, there's a method to doing this.

168
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,097
Because it's not like you can just start
fiddling around for about 20 hours

169
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,044
and expect these massive improvements.

170
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,713
There's a way to practice intelligently.

171
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,997
There's a way to practice efficiently,

172
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:41,051
that will make sure that you invest
those 20 hours

173
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,592
in the most effective way
that you possibly can.

174
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:47,518
And here's the method,
it applies to anything:

175
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:51,363
The first is to deconstruct the skill.

176
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:56,262
Decide exactly what you want
to be able to do when you're done,

177
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:02,072
and then look into the skill
and break it down into smaller pieces.

178
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:06,042
Most of the things
that we think of as skills

179
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:10,639
are actually big bundles of skills
that require all sorts of different things.

180
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,211
The more you can break apart the skill,

181
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,583
the more you're able to decide,

182
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,974
what are the parts of this skill
that would actually help me

183
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,365
get to what I want?

184
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,758
And then you can practice those first.

185
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,960
And if you practice
the most important things first,

186
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,731
you'll be able to improve
your performance

187
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,502
in the least amount of time possible.

188
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:34,273
The second is, learn enough
to self correct.

189
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:38,467
So, get three to five resources
about what it is you're trying to learn.

190
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,719
Could be book, could be DVDs,
could be courses, could be anything.

191
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:48,950
But don't use those as a way
to procrastinate on practice.

192
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,585
I know I do this, right?

193
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,661
Get like 20 books about the topic,
like,

194
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,138
"I'm going to start learning
how to program a computer

195
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,615
when I complete these 20 books".

196
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,094
No. That's procrastination.

197
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:04,141
What you want to do
is learn just enough

198
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,850
that you can actually practice

199
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,914
and self correct or self edit
as you practice.

200
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,819
So the learning becomes
a way of getting better

201
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:16,724
at noticing
when you're making a mistake

202
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,630
and then doing something
a little different.

203
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,106
The third is to remove barriers
to practice.

204
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,550
Distractions, television, internet.

205
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,929
All of these things
that get in the way

206
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,308
of you actually sitting down
and doing the work.

207
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,689
And the more you're able to use
just a little bit of willpower

208
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,887
to remove the distractions that
are keeping you from practicing,

209
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:46,270
the more likely you are to actually
sit down and practice, right?

210
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,473
And the fourth is to practice
for at least 20 hours.

211
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,770
Now, most skills have what I call
a frustration barrier.

212
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,078
You know, the grossly-incompetent-
and-knowing-it part?

213
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,374
That's really, really frustrating.
We don't like to feel stupid.

214
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:07,314
And feeling stupid is a barrier to us 
actually sitting down and doing the work.

215
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:11,762
So, by pre-committing to practicing
whatever it is that you want to do

216
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,378
for at least 20 hours,

217
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:18,918
you will be able to overcome
that initial frustration barrier

218
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:23,029
and stick with the practice long enough
to actually reap the rewards.

219
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,368
That's it! It's not rocket science.

220
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:30,479
Four very simple steps that
you can use to learn anything.

221
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:35,302
Now, this is easy to talk
about in theory,

222
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:37,703
but it's more fun to talk about
in practice.

223
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,964
So one of the things that I've wanted
to learn how to do for a long time

224
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,163
is play the ukulele.

225
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,787
Has anybody seen
Jake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk

226
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,901
where he plays the ukulele
and makes it sound like --

227
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,260
he's like a ukulele god.

228
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,026
It's amazing.

229
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:57,206
I saw it, I was like,
"That is so cool!"

230
00:12:57,206 --> 00:13:01,373
It's such a neat instrument.
I would really like to learn how to play.

231
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,960
And so I decided
that to test this theory

232
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,636
I wanted to put 20 hours
into practicing ukulele

233
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,819
and see where it got.

234
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,635
And so the first thing
about playing the ukulele is,

235
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:17,701
in order to practice,
you have to have one, right?

236
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:21,791
So, I got an ukulele and
-- My lovely assistant?

237
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,526
(Laughter)

238
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:29,973
Thank you sir.
I think I need the chord here.

239
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,569
It's not just an ukulele,
it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter)

240
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,204
Yeah.

241
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:45,195
So, the first couple hours are just
like the first couple hours of anything.

242
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,554
You have to get the tools
that you are using to practice.

243
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,616
You have to make sure
they're available.

244
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,582
My ukulele didn't come
with strings attached.

245
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,548
I had to figure out
how to put those on.

246
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,515
Like, that's kind of important, right?

247
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,468
And learning how to tune,
learning how to make sure

248
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,321
that all of the things
that need to be done

249
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:04,515
in order to start practicing
get done, right?

250
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:11,187
Now, one of the things when I was
ready to actually start practicing

251
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:15,996
was I looked in online databases
and songbooks for how to play songs.

252
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,088
And they say, okay, ukuleles, you can
play more than one string at a time,

253
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,969
so you can play chords, that's cool,

254
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,242
you are accompanying yourself,
yay you. (Laughter)

255
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:28,356
And when I started looking at songs,

256
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:32,471
I had an ukulele chord book
that had like hundreds of chords.

257
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,534
Looking at this and
"Wow, that's intimidating".

258
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,859
But when you look at the actual songs,

259
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:42,710
you see the same chords
over and over, right?

260
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,299
As it turns out, playing the ukulele
is kind of like doing anything,

261
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,552
There's a very small set of things
that are really important

262
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,422
and techniques that you'll use
all the time.

263
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:58,420
And in most songs
you'll use four, maybe five chords,

264
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,229
and that's it, that's the song.

265
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:04,993
You don't have to know hundreds,
as long as you know the four or the five.

266
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,813
So, while I was doing my research,

267
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:11,264
I found a wonderful little medley
of pop songs

268
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:16,178
by a band called Axis of Awesome.
(Whistles)

269
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,199
-- Somebody knows it. --

270
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,418
And what Axis of Awesome says
is that you can learn,

271
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:27,017
or you can play pretty much
any pop song of the past five decades,

272
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,685
if you know four chords,

273
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:33,062
and those chords are G, D, Em and C.

274
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:37,931
Four chords pump out
every pop song ever, right?

275
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,401
So I thought, this is cool!

276
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,584
I would like to play
every pop song ever. (Laughter)

277
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,627
So, that was the first song
I decided to learn,

278
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:49,445
and I would like to actually
share it with you. Ready?

279
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,423
(Applause)
Alright.

280
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:54,733
(Music)

281
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,104
(Singing)
Just a small town girl,

282
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:08,878
living in a lonely world,

283
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:14,652
she took the midnight train
going anywhere.

284
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:18,209
I heard that you settled down,
(Laughter)

285
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,672
that you found a girl,

286
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,013
that you're married now.

287
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,323
Every night in my dreams
(Laughter)

288
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,496
I see you, I feel you,

289
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:36,253
that is how I know you go on.
(Laughter)

290
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:42,227
I won't hesitate no more, no more.
It cannot wait, I'm yours.

291
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:47,600
'Cause you were amazing,
we did amazing things.

292
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,682
If I could, then I would,
I'd go wherever you will --

293
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:58,244
Can you feel the love tonight.
(Laughter)

294
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:03,400
I can't live with or without you.

295
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,190
When I find myself --

296
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,489
When I find myself in times of trouble,
mother Mary comes to me,

297
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:11,865
Sometimes I feel like I don't have partner.
No woman, no cry.

298
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,504
Yeah mama, this surely is a dream.

299
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,836
I come from a land down under.
(Laughter)

300
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,863
Once a jolly swagman
camped by a billabong.

301
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:22,253
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
(Laughter)

302
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:26,413
but here's my number, so call me

303
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:30,190
Hey sexy lady, op, op, op, op,
oppan gangnam style. (Laughter)

304
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,932
It's time to say goodbye.

305
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:45,790
Closing time, every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end.

306
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,861
(Singing and music ends)
(Applause)

307
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:01,199
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,856
I love that song.
(Laughter)

309
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:10,499
And I have a secret to share with you.

310
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,471
So, by playing that song for you,

311
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:19,221
I just hit my twentieth hour
of practicing the ukulele.

312
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:23,209
(Applause)
Thank you.

313
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,974
And so it's amazing, pretty much
anything that you can think of,

314
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,752
what do you want to do.

315
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:35,317
The major barrier to learn
something new is not intellectual,

316
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:40,998
it's not the process of you learning
a bunch of little tips or tricks or things.

317
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:44,753
The major barrier's emotional.
We're scared.

318
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:47,140
Feeling stupid doesn't feel good,

319
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:49,275
in the beginning of learning
anything new

320
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,537
you feel really stupid.

321
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:55,633
So the major barrier's not intellectual,
it's emotional.

322
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,971
But put 20 hours into anything.

323
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,377
It doesn't matter.
What do you want to learn?

324
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,848
Do you want to learn a language?
Want to learn how to cook?

325
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,114
Want to learn how to draw?

326
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:10,860
What turns you on?
What lights you up?

327
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,747
Go out and do that thing.
It only takes 20 hours.

328
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,093
Have fun.

329
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:19,060
(Applause)
