1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,197
I grew up to study the brain

2
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,656
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed

3
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:19,614
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

4
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:23,573
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

5
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:27,906
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,

6
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,156
I can connect them to my reality,

7
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,823
and I can make my dreams come true?

8
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:36,656
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia

9
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:42,114
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,

10
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,156
so they instead become delusion?

11
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:49,489
So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses.

12
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:53,114
And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston,

13
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:55,697
where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes,

14
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:58,989
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.

15
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:02,114
And in the lab,
we were asking the question,

16
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:04,989
"What are the biological differences

17
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:09,114
between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control,

18
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,822
as compared with the brains of individuals

19
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:16,781
diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

20
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:21,281
So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:

21
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:24,406
which cells are communicating
with which cells,

22
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,948
with which chemicals,

23
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,323
and then in what quantities
of those chemicals?

24
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,573
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

25
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:35,114
because I was performing
this type of research during the day,

26
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,239
but then in the evenings
and on the weekends,

27
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:43,823
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

28
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:47,114
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,

29
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:51,114
I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own.

30
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:56,073
A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain.

31
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,239
And in the course of four hours,

32
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,489
I watched my brain completely deteriorate

33
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:05,073
in its ability to process all information.

34
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,864
On the morning of the hemorrhage,

35
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:12,114
I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life.

36
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:16,156
I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body.

37
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:20,114
If you've ever seen a human brain,

38
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,989
it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another.

39
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,531
And I have brought for you
a real human brain.

40
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,114
(Groaning, laughter)

41
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,614
So this is a real human brain.

42
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,114
This is the front of the brain,

43
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:45,614
the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down,

44
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:49,073
and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head.

45
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,614
And when you look at the brain,

46
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:54,656
it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices

47
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:57,364
are completely separate from one another.

48
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,114
For those of you who understand computers,

49
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:04,073
our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor,

50
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:07,823
while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.

51
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:11,198
The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another

52
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,781
through the corpus callosum,

53
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:16,989
which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers.

54
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,114
But other than that,

55
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,406
the two hemispheres
are completely separate.

56
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:25,114
Because they process
information differently,

57
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,114
each of our hemispheres
think about different things,

58
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:31,739
they care about different things,
and, dare I say,

59
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,156
they have very different personalities.

60
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:40,906
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.

61
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,239
Assistant: It has been.

62
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,823
(Laughter)

63
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:50,198
Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment.

64
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:54,114
It's all about "right here, right now."

65
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:57,114
Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures

66
00:03:57,156 --> 00:04:01,114
and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies.

67
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:06,114
Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously

68
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,114
through all of our sensory systems

69
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:11,114
and then it explodes
into this enormous collage

70
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:15,114
of what this present moment looks like,

71
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:18,114
what this present moment
smells like and tastes like,

72
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:23,114
what it feels like
and what it sounds like.

73
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:28,114
I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me

74
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:31,698
through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere.

75
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:36,031
We are energy-beings
connected to one another

76
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,823
through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres

77
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:41,156
as one human family.

78
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,698
And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet,

79
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:49,114
here to make the world a better place.

80
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:55,156
And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful.

81
00:04:56,156 --> 00:05:01,114
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place.

82
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:05,281
Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically.

83
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:11,114
Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future.

84
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:14,114
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

85
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:16,739
that enormous collage
of the present moment

86
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,823
and start picking out details,
and more details about those details.

87
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:26,239
It then categorizes and organizes
all that information,

88
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:29,781
associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned,

89
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:33,573
and projects into the future
all of our possibilities.

90
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:38,114
And our left hemisphere
thinks in language.

91
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:43,073
It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world

92
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,114
to my external world.

93
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,906
It's that little voice that says to me,

94
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,739
"Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home.

95
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,114
I need them in the morning."

96
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,073
It's that calculating intelligence

97
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:58,906
that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry.

98
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:03,739
But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me,

99
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,614
"I am. I am."

100
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:11,614
And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am,"

101
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,281
I become separate.

102
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,531
I become a single solid individual,

103
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,864
separate from the energy flow around me

104
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,698
and separate from you.

105
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:24,531
And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke.

106
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:27,614
On the morning of the stroke,

107
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:31,948
I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye.

108
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:36,781
And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream.

109
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,656
And it just gripped me --

110
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,906
and then it released me.

111
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:43,031
And then it just gripped me --

112
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:44,781
and then it released me.

113
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:49,114
And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain,

114
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,739
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine."

115
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:54,114
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,

116
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,114
which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine.

117
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,573
And I'm jamming away on this thing,

118
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:05,364
and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws

119
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,864
grasping onto the bar.

120
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,864
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

121
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,364
And I looked down at my body

122
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,114
and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."

123
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,823
And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away

124
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,323
from my normal perception of reality,

125
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:23,323
where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience,

126
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,239
to some esoteric space

127
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:28,364
where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience.

128
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,364
And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse.

129
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,698
So I get off the machine,

130
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,114
and I'm walking
across my living room floor,

131
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,781
and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down.

132
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:44,239
And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate.

133
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:47,114
There's no fluidity to my pace,

134
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:50,073
and there's this constriction
in my area of perception,

135
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:53,114
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

136
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,698
And I'm standing in my bathroom

137
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:56,573
getting ready to step into the shower,

138
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,323
and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body.

139
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:03,114
I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract.

140
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:04,531
You muscles, you relax."

141
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:08,698
And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall.

142
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,656
And I look down at my arm

143
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:16,114
and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body.

144
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:19,948
I can't define where I begin
and where I end,

145
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,114
because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm

146
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:26,114
blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall.

147
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:30,114
And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy.

148
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:32,281
And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me?

149
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,114
What is going on?"

150
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:39,531
And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent.

151
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:43,823
Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button.

152
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,114
Total silence.

153
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:50,489
And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind.

154
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,739
But then I was immediately captivated

155
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:57,531
by the magnificence
of the energy around me.

156
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:01,447
And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body,

157
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:04,989
I felt enormous and expansive.

158
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:08,364
I felt at one with
all the energy that was,

159
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,531
and it was beautiful there.

160
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,406
Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online

161
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,614
and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem!

162
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,156
We've got to get some help."

163
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:19,197
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"

164
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,739
(Laughter)

165
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:22,781
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."

166
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:27,281
But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness --

167
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:31,156
and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land.

168
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,531
But it was beautiful there.

169
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,572
Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected

170
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:40,114
from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world.

171
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,989
So here I am in this space,

172
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:46,114
and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone.

173
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,489
And I felt lighter in my body.

174
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:53,114
And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world

175
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:56,114
and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone.

176
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,322
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

177
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,781
And imagine
what it would feel like to lose

178
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:06,572
37 years of emotional baggage!

179
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:12,114
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

180
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,989
euphoria.

181
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,114
It was beautiful.

182
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,781
And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says,

183
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:19,447
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

184
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:20,864
We've got to get help."

185
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,739
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus."

186
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,239
So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress

187
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,072
and I'm walking around my apartment,

188
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:32,114
and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"

189
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,406
And in that moment,

190
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,781
my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side.

191
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:40,114
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!"

192
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,781
And the next thing my brain says to me is,

193
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,156
Wow! This is so cool!

194
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,114
(Laughter)

195
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,739
This is so cool!

196
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:51,281
How many brain scientists
have the opportunity

197
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:54,114
to study their own brain
from the inside out?"

198
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,114
(Laughter)

199
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,114
And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!"

200
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:01,322
(Laughter)

201
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,489
"I don't have time for a stroke!"

202
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:06,239
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening,

203
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:10,114
so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

204
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,614
So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work."

205
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:14,531
I couldn't remember the number at work,

206
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:18,322
so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number.

207
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:22,656
So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards.

208
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,322
And I'm looking at the card on top

209
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:27,697
and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye

210
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,447
what my business card looked like,

211
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,031
I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not,

212
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,947
because all I could see were pixels.

213
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:38,031
And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background

214
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,364
and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell.

215
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:44,531
And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity.

216
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,864
And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality

217
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:53,031
and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card.

218
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:59,072
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards.

219
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,947
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,

220
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,614
the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere.

221
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,656
I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone,

222
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:08,239
but it's the only plan I have.

223
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,947
So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here.

224
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,364
I take the business card,
I put it right here,

225
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:17,114
and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card

226
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,489
to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad.

227
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,114
But then I would drift back out
into La La Land,

228
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:27,114
and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers.

229
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:31,114
So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump

230
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:35,114
and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them,

231
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:37,864
so that as I would come back
to normal reality,

232
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:41,864
I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number."

233
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:46,239
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone,

234
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,906
and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me,

235
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:51,489
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)

236
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,947
(Laughter)

237
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,822
And I think to myself,

238
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,906
"Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!"

239
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,531
(Laughter)

240
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,739
And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him:

241
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:06,406
"This is Jill! I need help!"

242
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:10,114
And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo."

243
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,947
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever."

244
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,906
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know

245
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:18,572
that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried.

246
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:21,947
So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help.

247
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:25,864
And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance

248
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,447
from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

249
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,656
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

250
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:40,031
And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air,

251
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,197
just right out of the balloon,

252
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:47,489
I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender.

253
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:54,114
And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life.

254
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:58,531
And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life,

255
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,239
or this was perhaps
my moment of transition.

256
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,072
When I woke later that afternoon,

257
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,739
I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive.

258
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:19,114
When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life.

259
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,489
And my mind was now suspended

260
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:25,697
between two very opposite
planes of reality.

261
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,031
Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems

262
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,739
felt like pure pain.

263
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:34,531
Light burned my brain like wildfire,

264
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:38,156
and sounds were so loud and chaotic

265
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:42,364
that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise,

266
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,364
and I just wanted to escape.

267
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:50,114
Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space,

268
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,947
I felt enormous and expansive,

269
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:57,572
like a genie just liberated
from her bottle.

270
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:01,489
And my spirit soared free,

271
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:07,156
like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria.

272
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,406
Nirvana.

273
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,822
I found Nirvana.

274
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,531
And I remember thinking,

275
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:20,989
there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself

276
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,531
back inside this tiny little body.

277
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,489
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!

278
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,614
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.

279
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:36,322
And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive,

280
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:40,322
then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana."

281
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:43,864
And I pictured a world

282
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:49,822
filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people

283
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:53,614
who knew that they could come
to this space at any time.

284
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:57,822
And that they could purposely choose

285
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,614
to step to the right
of their left hemispheres --

286
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,114
and find this peace.

287
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:05,364
And then I realized

288
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:08,947
what a tremendous gift
this experience could be,

289
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:14,864
what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives.

290
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,781
And it motivated me to recover.

291
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:26,239
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in,

292
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,822
and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball

293
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,822
that was pushing on my language centers.

294
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,489
Here I am with my mama,

295
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,406
who is a true angel in my life.

296
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:39,572
It took me eight years
to completely recover.

297
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:42,864
So who are we?

298
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:47,864
We are the life-force power
of the universe,

299
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:52,197
with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds.

300
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:56,072
And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment,

301
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:59,114
who and how we want to be in the world.

302
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:01,364
Right here, right now,

303
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:06,614
I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are.

304
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,697
I am the life-force power of the universe.

305
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:11,239
I am the life-force power

306
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:16,114
of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form,

307
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,406
at one with all that is.

308
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:24,489
Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere,

309
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:27,823
where I become
a single individual, a solid.

310
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:31,406
Separate from the flow, separate from you.

311
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,531
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

312
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,364
intellectual, neuroanatomist.

313
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:42,031
These are the "we" inside of me.

314
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:45,156
Which would you choose?

315
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:49,364
Which do you choose?

316
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:52,281
And when?

317
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,114
I believe that the more time we spend

318
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:00,114
choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry

319
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,364
of our right hemispheres,

320
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:05,698
the more peace we will project
into the world,

321
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,281
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

322
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,406
And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading.

323
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,239
Thank you.

324
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,239
(Applause)
