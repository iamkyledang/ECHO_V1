2
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:16,470
So, I was on a roll.

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,972
I was an executive with a nice salary,

4
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,901
annual bonuses, and stock options,

5
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,062
all the perks.

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,342
Everything was on track.

7
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:28,263
And on Monday, January 7th, 2008

8
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:30,345
at three o'clock in the afternoon,

9
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,753
in a small conference room
on the top floor of our building,

10
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,953
the president of the company
wanted to have a quick meeting with me,

11
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,704
which wasn't unusual since he was my boss.

12
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:43,373
But the meeting turned out
to be even more brief than expected.

13
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,333
He fired me.

14
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:52,784
And I'll never forget how his words
just sucked the breath right out of me,

15
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,534
and I left the conference room
in a dazed state,

16
00:00:56,534 --> 00:01:00,813
and I went home and curled up in my bed
in the fetal position for three hours.

17
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:04,814
And while I could go on
in vivid detail about how I felt,

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,074
what it did to my self-esteem,
my finances, and so on,

19
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:09,954
what I now realize is,

20
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:15,394
while that event created the greatest
amount of discomfort I had ever felt,

21
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,454
it was that discomfort,

22
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,104
the departure from my ordered life,

23
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:22,674
that forever changed it for the better.

24
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:24,614
You see, friends,

25
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,454
what makes you comfortable can ruin you,

26
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:31,012
and what makes you uncomfortable
is the only way to grow.

27
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,245
Let me say that again:

28
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,516
What makes you comfortable can ruin you,

29
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:38,815
and only in a state of discomfort,
can you continually grow.

30
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:42,545
Now, I suppose if on January 8th,
had somebody come up and said,

31
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:46,481
"Gee buddy, getting fired is a good thing
because now you're really going to grow!"

32
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,511
I probably would have smacked them.

33
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:53,215
But, pretty quickly I became motivated
to start a new journey,

34
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,765
and after a couple years
of work with my new team

35
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,714
and a PhD friend
at the University of Nebraska,

36
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,176
we had this epiphany

37
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:05,973
on how to illustrate and apply
the science of discomfort and growth.

38
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:09,683
We called the concept: the "Growth Rings."

39
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:13,135
The Growth Rings represent
living environments

40
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,377
that promote or hinder growth.

41
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:18,037
And that includes everything
from your place of work,

42
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,097
to even a fishbowl.

43
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:23,757
You see, what dictates
the size of a goldfish

44
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,007
is its environment.

45
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,387
And while this goldfish
lives in a very safe environment,

46
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,947
it's also very limiting in most every way.

47
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:33,593
And when placed
in a more robust environment,

48
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:37,038
like, say, a small pond,
this can be the result.

49
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,299
Now, it also means he could be eaten.

50
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,058
But friends, this is you -

51
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,635
the environments
in which you work, live, and play,

52
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:50,379
they're all a proverbial fishbowl
that dictates your growth.

53
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:56,499
So, the first Growth Ring represents
a low-performing, low-growth environment,

54
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,929
called stagnation.

55
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,569
Stagnation is understood
by having to follow too many steps,

56
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,449
and permissions, and minutiae.

57
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,760
That stifles creativity,
independent thought, and action.

58
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,556
To imagine an environment such as this,

59
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,570
think no further than our state
and federal governments.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,491
Now, the antithesis
of stagnation is chaos,

61
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,851
also low-growth and low-performing.

62
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:25,200
Chaos can be caused by internal
or external events or conditions.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,009
We see chaos occur at times
in business mergers,

64
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,481
natural disasters,
and horrific events like 9/11.

65
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:36,381
Chaos is having
zero predictability or control

66
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,571
over inputs and outcomes.

67
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,881
Coming back down the Growth Rings,

68
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:46,151
next to stagnation is
the most desirable environment: order.

69
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:51,721
Order is knowing that what you do,
or what is happening in your environment,

70
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,882
leads to a predictable outcome.

71
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:58,163
And in predictability, comfort is found.

72
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:01,783
But comfort is also
what makes order so dangerous.

73
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,836
Because science shows that anytime
you continually do something,

74
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:07,823
or even think about something
the same way,

75
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,363
you'll eventually stop growing.

76
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,885
And this applies to every living thing -

77
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,154
even our dog.

78
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:18,824
You see, if Aspen had a chance,

79
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:22,205
she'd choose comfort six days a week
and twice on Sundays.

80
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,505
(Laughter)

81
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:25,735
But too much growth-limiting order

82
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,814
would have prevented her
from becoming a therapy dog,

83
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,484
and had this been allowed,

84
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:36,875
think of the lives this gentle soul
would not be touching today.

85
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:43,885
So, before your order continues
to limit the way you think and act,

86
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,015
remember what I said earlier:

87
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,964
Growth only occurs
in a state of discomfort.

88
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,165
Now, think about the power of that phrase:

89
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,505
Growth only occurs
in a state of discomfort.

90
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:58,965
I can unequivocally state,
I wouldn't be standing on this stage today

91
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,356
without my uncomfortable,
order-disrupting day, nine years ago -

92
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:08,685
by the way I'm not recommending you go
get fired to see if it leads to a TEDTalk.

93
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:09,945
(Laughter)

94
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:13,365
When you feel discomfort hit,

95
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,486
that means you've entered
the complexity ring.

96
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:22,346
Complexity is nothing more
than changed order,

97
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:27,245
but when your order is changed,
outcomes are no longer predictable,

98
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:31,327
and it's unpredictability
that makes you uncomfortable.

99
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,307
And while most times

100
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:37,537
your visceral response to discomfort
is not just "No" but "Hell, no,"

101
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,593
you can actually learn
how empowering it is

102
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:43,507
to consciously acknowledge discomfort,

103
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:47,557
and then, when appropriate,
choose complexity over order.

104
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:51,487
And I know seeking discomfort sounds odd,
and not many people do it,

105
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,537
but you have to learn to embrace it

106
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,477
because it's the only environment

107
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:59,708
where sustained
or exponential growth can occur.

108
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,208
Okay.

109
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:07,749
To weave high-growth complexity
into the fabric of your lives,

110
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,980
there are three primary ways
it can be triggered.

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,810
Complexity trigger number one
is it can be forced upon you.

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,789
When I got fired, I didn't have
a chance to stay in order,

113
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,680
complexity was selected for me,
and when this happens,

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,070
how much you grow
depends on how you respond to it.

115
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,770
Now, I could have remained angry,
I could have used it as an excuse,

116
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,240
but what I actually learned
is that I suck as an employee,

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,270
and I'm much better off accepting
the risks of running my own company.

118
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,490
Complexity trigger number two:
Someone can help you get there.

119
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,800
This is the role of parents,
teachers, coaches, and bosses.

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Because left on their own,

121
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,710
people will consciously or subconsciously
select the comfort of order.

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,741
And they then need to be
pushed into complexity

123
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,461
in order to continue growing.

124
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:10,160
My youngest daughter
spent most of her high school life

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,990
training to play tennis,

126
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,311
and her coach was
pretty familiar with our work

127
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,311
on complexity and the Growth Rings.

128
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,441
So, I called him up one day
to check on Maddie's progress,

129
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,021
and I was able to phrase
my question like this, I said:

130
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,251
"Hey, Lee, how long has it been

131
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:27,221
since Maddie's been pushed
deep into complexity?"

132
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,909
Lee's response:

133
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,551
"Hmm, funny you'd ask Bill.
We got there yesterday.

134
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,181
She broke down into tears
on the tennis court."

135
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,518
"Huh."

136
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:43,292
Well, knowing how tough my daughter is,
and the fact that she never cries,

137
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,541
told me she was deep into complexity.

138
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:51,841
But, friends, this is where critical
developmental decisions are made

139
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:54,705
because the old Bill,
the pre-Growth Ring Bill,

140
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:59,092
would have intervened and wanted to know
what was making her so uncomfortable.

141
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,951
Then I would have done everything I could
to try and get her happy again.

142
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:05,001
What I really would have been doing

143
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,332
is removing the complexity,
and putting her in order.

144
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:12,232
I actually would have been stifling
her development.

145
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:18,833
But the new, post-Growth Ring Bill
relished in his daughter's discomfort.

146
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,343
(Laughter)

147
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:25,503
And it was the coach's next words
that told me everything I needed to hear.

148
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:29,703
He said, "Bill, I've got to tell you,
it took a heck of a lot more

149
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:32,783
to get her to the limits
of complexity this month,

150
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,995
than it did last month."

151
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,480
Discomfort was causing her growth.

152
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,094
Okay, but what if you're not lucky enough

153
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:46,418
to live or work in a robust
high-growth environment?

154
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,925
What if you're stuck in order,
even worse, stagnation?

155
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,055
Well, the great news is,

156
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:56,654
everyone can trigger
complexity at any time.

157
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:02,444
So, complexity trigger number three:
Trigger it yourself.

158
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,285
Take a journey with me
back to Montgomery, Alabama

159
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,634
in the 1950s.

160
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:12,585
Imagine, if you will
a young girl, who's black,

161
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,545
and she attends an all-black high school.

162
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,844
And she takes the city bus
to get there and home,

163
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:19,195
which wasn't unusual in that era.

164
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:24,254
And on March 2, 1955,
she boards a bus to come home from school,

165
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:25,852
and she sits near the back,

166
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,325
in the first row of seats
where blacks were allowed to sit.

167
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,395
And as the bus continues
to fill with white people,

168
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,856
there's eventually
no more room in the front.

169
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,706
And according to local law

170
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:41,797
she needed to move further back
to create room for white people to sit.

171
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:45,147
You see, Montgomery had an order in place

172
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:49,035
that when followed,
led to a very predictable outcome:

173
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,246
repression of people with little conflict.

174
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:57,057
But 15-year-old Claudette Colvin

175
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:00,257
had just spent the last month
in high school studying black history,

176
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:04,773
and she was understandably fed up
with the historic and existing atrocities.

177
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:09,756
And so on this day, she decided
she didn't like Montgomery's order,

178
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,997
and by refusing to give up her seat,

179
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:18,978
she sent a community, our laws,
and our entire country into complexity.

180
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:24,767
Yes, nine months before Rosa Parks
made her famous decision to stay put,

181
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,717
it was a 15-year-old girl

182
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:30,396
that was handcuffed, dragged
from the bus, and taken to prison.

183
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:34,467
It was Miss Colvin, not Rosa Parks,
who first fought the law,

184
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,758
and by the way,

185
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,977
was also the star plaintiff to testify
in the famous lawsuit

186
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:41,797
that went all the way
to the US Supreme Court.

187
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:43,628
So,

188
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:49,628
I use Claudette's actions
not to heighten awareness of race issues,

189
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,468
although that's not necessarily bad,

190
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,820
but I used it as an example
of every issue,

191
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,078
of every situation
in an ordered environment.

192
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,879
It's a real and perfect example
of complexity forcing people,

193
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,958
our communities,
and our courts into discomfort,

194
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,318
and the downstream impact that can occur

195
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:13,078
anytime someone elects to move from order.

196
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:21,068
Dr. Serene Jones, in a recent book,
summarizes this concept very eloquently.

197
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:24,278
She said: "The constant facade of order

198
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,100
hides the wilderness that is craving
to seep out and teach us

199
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,368
that life wasn't created
to be what we think it is.

200
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:34,818
Beyond words, we must
experience the wilderness

201
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:38,790
to be taught what cannot
be otherwise known."

202
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
So, friends,

203
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,230
it's not the discomfort of losing a job,

204
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,120
it's not having a child break down
on the tennis court,

205
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,940
but it's order you should fear the most
because it is a threat.

206
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,280
And order-disrupting people

207
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,090
like Jesus, Galileo,
Claudette Colvin, Aspen's trainer,

208
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,481
and maybe even a few of you
have already proven -

209
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,181
now, think about this -

210
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:09,460
it's not the complexity-triggering
individuals or events

211
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,380
you should fear the most,

212
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,942
but it's your own willingness
to accept or seek discomfort

213
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:20,092
that will dictate the growth
of not just you,

214
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,982
but our entire world.

215
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:25,871
Thank you very much
for allowing me to be a part of this.

216
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,422
(Applause)
