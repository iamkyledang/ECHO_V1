1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Mr.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,400
Tim Minchin.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,660
In darker days,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,420
I did a corporate gig at a conference for

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,740
this big company who made and sold

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,720
accounting software.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,680
In a bid, I presumed to inspire their

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
salespeople to greater heights. They'd

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,860
forked out 12 grand for an inspirational

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,260
speaker who was this extreme sports guy

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,920
who had a couple of his limbs frozen

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,400
off when he got stuck on a ledge on some

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,100
mountain.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,340
It was weird.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,600
Software salespeople, I think, need to

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,900
hear from someone who has had a long,

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,900
successful and happy career in software

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,200
sales, not from an overly optimistic ex

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,960
-mountaineer.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,500
Some poor guy who had arrived in the

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,560
morning hoping to learn more about sales

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,220
techniques ended up going home worried

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,060
about the blood flow to his extremities.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
It's not inspirational, it's confusing.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,340
And if the mountain was meant to be a

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,200
symbol of life's challenges and the loss

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,060
of limbs and metaphor for sacrifice,

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,300
the software guy is not going to get it,

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,180
is he? Because he didn't do an art

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,900
degree, did he?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,420
He should have. Arts degrees are awesome,

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,180
and they help you find meaning where there

33
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,720
is none.

34
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,540
And let me assure you,

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
there is none.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,420
Don't go looking for it. Searching for

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,300
meaning is like searching for a rhyme

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,620
scheme in a cookbook.

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,280
You won't find it, and it'll bugger up

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,900
your souffle.

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,620
If you didn't like that metaphor, you

42
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,700
won't like the rest of it.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,160
Point being, I'm not an inspirational

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,280
speaker. I've never lost a limb on a

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,160
mountainside metaphorically or otherwise,

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
and I'm certainly not here to give career

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,380
advice because,

48
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,460
well, I've never really had what most

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,780
would consider a job.

50
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,040
However, I have had large groups of people

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,600
listening to what I say for quite a few

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
years now, and it's given me an inflated

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
sense of self-importance.

54
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,460
So I will now, at the ripe old age of 37

55
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,080
.9,

56
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,740
bestow upon you nine life lessons.

57
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,400
To echo, of course, the nine lessons of

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,640
carols of the traditional Christmas

59
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,120
service,

60
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,160
which is also pretty obscure.

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,740
You might find some of this stuff

62
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,340
inspiring. You will definitely find some

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,840
of it boring, and you will definitely

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
forget all of it within a week.

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,780
And be warned, there will be lots of hokey

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,380
similes and obscure aphorisms which start

67
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,480
well but end up making no sense.

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,620
So listen up, or you'll get lost, like a

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,660
blind man clapping in a pharmacy trying to

70
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,380
echo locate the contact lens fluid.

71
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,700
It's looking for my old poetry teacher.

72
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,220
Here we go.

73
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,940
Ready?

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,900
You don't have to have a dream.

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,620
Americans on talent shows always talk

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,020
about their dreams. Fine, if you have

77
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,700
something you've always wanted to do,

78
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,940
dreamed of, like in your heart, go for it.

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,520
After all, it's something to do with your

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
time, chasing a dream.

81
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,320
And if it's a big enough one,

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,140
it'll take you most of your life to

83
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,580
achieve, so by the time you get to it, and

84
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,580
are staring into the abyss of the

85
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,940
meaninglessness of your achievement,

86
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,980
you'll be almost dead, so it won't matter.

87
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,480
I never really had one of these dreams,

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,160
and so I advocate passionate dedication to

89
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
the pursuit of short -term goals.

90
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Be micro -ambitious. Put your head down

91
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,060
and work with pride on whatever is in

92
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,940
front of you. You never know where you

93
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,100
might end up. Just be aware the next

94
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,220
worthy pursuit will probably appear in

95
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,160
your periphery, which is why you should be

96
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,540
careful of long -term dreams. If you focus

97
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,640
too far in front of you, you won't see the

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,600
shiny thing out the corner of your eye.

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,640
Right?

100
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,240
Good.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,820
Advice, metaphor.

102
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Look at me go. Two,

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,320
don't seek happiness. Happiness is like an

104
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,960
orgasm.

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,240
If you think about it too much, it goes

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,680
away.

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,200
LAUGHTER

108
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,260
Keep busy and aim to make someone else

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,060
happy, and you might find you get some as

110
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,780
a side effect. We didn't evolve to be

111
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,900
constantly content.

112
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,440
Contented Homo erectus got eaten before

113
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,480
passing on their genes.

114
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,040
Three,

115
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,480
remember it's all luck.

116
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,760
You are lucky to be here. You are

117
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,140
incalculably lucky to be born, and

118
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,780
incredibly lucky to be brought up by a

119
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,420
nice family that helped you get educated

120
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,740
and encouraged you to go to uni.

121
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,340
Or if you're born into a horrible family,

122
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,820
that's unlucky and you have my sympathy,

123
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,820
but you're still lucky.

124
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,850
happened to be made of the sort of DNA

125
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,810
that went on to make the sort of brain

126
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,530
which, when placed in a horrible childhood

127
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,010
environment, would make decisions that

128
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,730
meant you ended up eventually graduating

129
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,070
uni.

130
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,370
Well done, you, for dragging yourself up

131
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,430
by your shoelaces, but you were lucky. You

132
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,090
didn't create the bit of you that dragged

133
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,150
you up, they're not even your shoelaces.

134
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,850
Now, suppose I worked hard to achieve

135
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,370
whatever dubious achievements I've

136
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,010
achieved, but I didn't make the bit of me

137
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,890
that works hard,

138
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,730
and more than,

139
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,110
any more than I made the bit of me that

140
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,770
ate too many burgers instead of attending

141
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,370
lectures when I was here at UWA.

142
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,570
Understanding that you can't truly take

143
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,210
credit for your successes, nor truly blame

144
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,190
others for their failures, will humble you

145
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,490
and make you more compassionate.

146
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,110
Empathy is intuitive, but it's also

147
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,610
something you can work on intellectually.

148
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,470
Four,

149
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:22,930
exercise.

150
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,150
I'm sorry you pasty -pale, smoking

151
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,610
philosophy grads, arching your eyebrows

152
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,770
into a Cartesian curve as you watch the

153
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,850
human movement mob winding their way

154
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,770
through them, the miniature traffic cones

155
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,470
of their existence.

156
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,590
You are wrong and they are right.

157
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,890
Well, you're half right. You think

158
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,490
therefore you are, but also you jog,

159
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,030
therefore you sleep, therefore you're not

160
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,670
overwhelmed by existential angst. You

161
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,650
can't be can't, and you don't want to be.

162
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,510
Play a sport, do yoga, pump high and run,

163
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,030
whatever, but take care of your body.

164
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,330
You're going to need it. Most of you mob

165
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,370
are going to live to nearly 100, and even

166
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,170
the poorest of you will achieve a level of

167
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,730
wealth that most humans throughout history

168
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,750
could not have dreamed of.

169
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,790
And this long, luxurious life ahead of you

170
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,890
is going to make you depressed.

171
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,290
But don't despair, there is an inverse

172
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,730
correlation between depression and

173
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,110
exercise.

174
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,470
Do it, run, my beautiful intellectuals,

175
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:14,710
run.

176
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,230
on your opinions.

177
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,010
A famous Bon Motto asserts that opinions

178
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,970
are like assholes and that everyone has

179
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,250
one.

180
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,070
There is great wisdom in this, but I would

181
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,710
add that opinions differ significantly

182
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,350
from assholes and that yours should be

183
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,170
constantly and thoroughly examined.

184
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,010
I used to do exams in here.

185
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,190
It's revenge.

186
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,990
We must think critically and not just

187
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,450
about the ideas of others. Be hard on your

188
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,290
beliefs, take them out onto the verandah

189
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,570
and hit them with a cricket bat.

190
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,330
Be intellectually rigorous, identify your

191
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,870
biases, your prejudices, your privileges.

192
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,170
Most of society's arguments are kept alive

193
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,250
by a failure to acknowledge nuance.

194
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,130
We tend to generate false dichotomies and

195
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,090
then try to argue one point using two

196
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,490
entirely different sets of assumptions,

197
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,950
like two tennis players trying to win a

198
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,610
match by hitting beautifully executed

199
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,850
shots from either end of separate tennis

200
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,270
courts.

201
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,410
By the way, while I have science and arts

202
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,030
graduates in front of me, please don't

203
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,690
make the mistake of thinking the arts and

204
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,610
sciences are at odds with one another.

205
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,310
That is a recent, stupid and damaging

206
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,770
idea.

207
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,250
You don't have to be unscientific to make

208
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,510
beautiful art to write beautiful things.

209
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,710
If you need proof,

210
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,950
Twain, Douglas Adams, Vonnegut, McEwan,

211
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,670
Sagan, Shakespeare, Dickens for a start.

212
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,450
You don't need to be superstitious to be a

213
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,610
poet. You don't need to hate GM technology

214
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,230
to care about the beauty of the planet.

215
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,330
You don't have to claim a soul to promote

216
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,910
compassion.

217
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,670
Science is not a body of knowledge nor a

218
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,650
belief system. It is just a term which

219
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,390
describes humankind's incremental

220
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,470
acquisition of understanding through

221
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:01,970
observation.

222
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,610
Science is awesome.

223
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,930
The arts and sciences need to work

224
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,510
together to improve how knowledge is

225
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,010
communicated.

226
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,690
The idea that many Australians, including

227
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,710
our new PM and my distant cousin, Nick

228
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,110
Min chin,

229
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,610
believe that the science of anthropogenic

230
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,050
global warming is controversial is a

231
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,890
powerful indicator of the extent of our

232
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,950
failure to communicate.

233
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,730
The fact that 30 % of the people in this

234
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,450
room just bristled is further evidence

235
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:25,850
still.

236
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,050
The fact that bristling is more to do

237
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,250
with politics than science is even more

238
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,950
despairing.

239
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,690
Six.

240
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,130
Be a teacher, please,

241
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,210
please, please be a teacher.

242
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,110
Teachers are the most admirable and

243
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,610
important people in the world. You don't

244
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,370
have to do it forever, but if you're in

245
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,370
doubt about what to do, be an amazing

246
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,070
teacher.

247
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,070
Just fear 20s. Be a teacher. Be a primary

248
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,990
school teacher, especially if you're a

249
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,650
bloke. We need male primary school

250
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,130
teachers.

251
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,050
Even if you're not a teacher,

252
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,430
be a teacher.

253
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,490
Share your ideas. Don't take for granted

254
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,650
your education. Rejoice in what you learn

255
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,170
and spray it.

256
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,410
Seven.

257
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,770
Define yourself by what you love.

258
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,250
I found myself doing this thing a bit

259
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,310
recently where if someone asked me what

260
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,070
sort of music I like, I say, well, I don't

261
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,330
listen to the radio because pop song

262
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,230
lyrics annoy me. Or if someone asked me

263
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,050
what food I like, I say, I think truffle

264
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,990
oil is overused and slightly obnoxious.

265
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,750
And I see it all the time online. People

266
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,870
whose idea of being part of a subculture

267
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,470
is to hate Coldplay or football or

268
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,850
feminists or the liberal party.

269
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,530
We have a tendency to define ourselves in

270
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,170
opposition to stuff. As a comedian, I make

271
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,090
my living out of it.

272
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,830
But try to also express your passion for

273
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,610
things you love.

274
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,710
Be demonstrative and generous in your

275
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,010
praise of those you admire.

276
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,150
Send thank you cards and give standing

277
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,990
ovations. Be pro stuff, not just anti

278
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,370
stuff.

279
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,330
Eight.

280
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,610
Respect people with less power than you.

281
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,090
I have in the past made important

282
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,150
decisions about people I work with, agents

283
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,830
and producers, big decisions based largely

284
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,630
on how they treat the weight stuff in the

285
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,090
restaurants we're having the meeting in.

286
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,310
I don't care if you're the most powerful

287
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,570
cat in the room. I will judge you on how

288
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,670
you treat the least powerful.

289
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,070
So there.

290
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,490
Nine.

291
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,010
Finally, don't rush.

292
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,630
You don't need to already know what you're

293
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,950
going to do with the rest of your life.

294
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,990
I'm not saying sit around smoking cones

295
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,250
all day, but also don't panic.

296
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,170
Most people I know who were sure of their

297
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,090
career path at 20 are having midlife

298
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,970
crises now.

299
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,950
I said at the beginning of this ramble,

300
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,150
which is already three and a half minutes

301
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,550
long, that life is meaningless.

302
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,190
It was not a flippant assertion. I think

303
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,950
it's absurd the idea of seeking meaning in

304
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,810
the set of circumstances that happens to

305
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,750
exist after 13 .8 billion years worth of

306
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,590
unguided events.

307
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,110
Leave it to humans to think the universe

308
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,350
has a purpose for them.

309
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,510
However, I'm no nihilist. I'm not even a

310
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,750
cynic. I am actually rather romantic.

311
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,430
And here's my idea of romance.

312
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,790
You will soon be dead.

313
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,470
Life will sometimes seem long and tough

314
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,950
and God, it's tiring.

315
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,350
And you will sometimes be happy and

316
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,030
sometimes sad. And then you'll be old and

317
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,730
then you'll be dead.

318
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,170
There is only one sensible thing to do

319
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,190
with this empty existence. And that is

320
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,230
fill it.

321
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,030
Not fill it.

322
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,070
Fill it.

323
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,530
And in my opinion, until I change it,

324
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,470
life is best filled by learning as much as

325
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,470
you can about as much as you can, taking

326
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,010
pride in whatever you're doing, having

327
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,450
compassion, sharing ideas,

328
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,530
running,

329
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,570
being enthusiastic.

330
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,170
And then there's love and travel and wine

331
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,430
and sex and art and kids and giving and

332
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,170
mountain climbing.

333
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,110
But you know all that stuff already.

334
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,150
It's an incredibly exciting thing,

335
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,410
this one

336
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,530
meaningless life of yours.

337
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,210
Good luck and thank you for indulging me.

338
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,430
Chancellor, Tim Minchin is an Australian

339
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,470
musician,

340
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,390
composer,

341
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,430
songwriter,

342
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,330
actor,

343
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,030
comedian,

344
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,170
and writer.

345
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,890
This understated description from Tim's

346
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,750
self -pend profile sits in modest contrast

347
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,510
to the comments of Tim Arthur, editor of

348
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,470
Time Out, who wrote,

349
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,790
Tim Minchin is a genius,

350
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,750
pure and simple.

351
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,610
He is to musical comedy what Charles

352
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,610
Darwin was to evolution and what Einstein

353
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,890
was to physics and mustaches.

354
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,950
You'd be hard pushed to find a more

355
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,330
sublimely talented comedian,

356
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,770
handsome,

357
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,890
hysterical,

358
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,250
and divinely musically gifted.

359
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,990
Originally from Perth in WA, Tim, his wife

360
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,290
Sarah, and their two children now live in

361
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:50,550
London.

362
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,490
He's part of a large and close-knit family

363
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,950
and has always enjoyed their full support.

364
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,910
Tim is an alumnus of Christchurch Grammar

365
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,950
School and the University of Western

366
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,470
Australia.

367
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,350
He graduated from UWA in 1996 with a

368
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,030
Bachelor of Arts in English and Theatre.

369
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,730
In 1997,

370
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,810
he was accepted into the West Australian
