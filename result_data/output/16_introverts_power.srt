1
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,040
So I was on a roll.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
I was an executive with a nice salary,

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,380
annual bonuses and stock options, all the

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:21,660
perks.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,800
Everything was on track.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,580
And on Monday,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,060
January 7th, 2008,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,840
at three o 'clock in the afternoon in a

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,960
small conference room on the top floor of

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,160
our building, the president of the company

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,940
wanted to have a quick meeting with me,

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,000
which wasn't unusual since he was my boss.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,780
But the meeting turned out to be even more

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,700
briefer than expected.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,800
He fired me.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,000
And I'll never forget how his words just

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,440
sucked the breath right out of me.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,960
And I left the conference room in a dazed

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,980
state, and I went home and curled up my

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,100
bed in the fetal position for three hours.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,720
And while I could go on in detail about

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,100
how I felt, what I did to my self-esteem,

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,700
my finances, and so on,

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,920
what I now realize is while that event

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,380
created the greatest amount of discomfort

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,040
I had to depart.

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,320
that forever changed it for the better.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,340
You see friends,

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,880
what makes you comfortable can ruin you.

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,200
What makes you uncomfortable is the only

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,720
way to grow.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,700
Let me say that again, what makes you

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,260
comfortable can ruin you and only in a

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,580
state of discomfort can you continually

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:37,940
grow.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,960
Now I suppose on January 8th somebody come

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,060
up and said, gee buddy,

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,260
getting fired's a good thing because now

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,020
you're really going to grow.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,840
I probably want to smack them,

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,220
but pretty quickly I became motivated to

42
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,880
start a new journey and after a couple

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,320
years of work with my new team and a PhD

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,920
friend at the University of Nebraska, we

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,080
had this epiphany on how to illustrate and

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,380
apply the science of discomfort and

47
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,660
growth.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,080
We called the concept the growth rings.

49
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,000
The growth rings represent living

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,940
environments that promote or hinder growth

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,860
and that includes everything from your

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,300
place of work to even a fishbowl. You see

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,220
what dictates the size of goldfish is its

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,900
environment and while this goldfish lives

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,060
in a very safe environment, it's also very

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,620
limiting in almost every way and when placed

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,320
in a more robust environment like say a

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,900
small pond,

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
this can be the result.

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
Now it also means he could be eaten,

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,360
but friends,

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,460
this is you.

63
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,040
The environments in which you work,

64
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,860
live, and play, they're all a proverbial

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,960
fishbowl that dictates your growth.

66
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,420
So the first growth ring represents a low

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,700
performing, low growth environment called

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,340
stagnation.

69
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,520
Stagnation is understood by having to

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,680
follow too many steps and permissions of

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
minutiae that stifle creativity,

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,980
independent thought,

73
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,740
and action.

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,400
To imagine an environment such as this,

75
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,380
think no further than our state and

76
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,080
federal governments.

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,380
Now the antithesis of stagnation is chaos,

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,420
also low growth and low performing.

79
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,120
Chaos can be caused by internal or

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
external events or conditions.

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,140
We see chaos occur at times in business

82
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,640
mergers,

83
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,160
natural disasters,

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,960
and horrific events like 9 -11.

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,300
Chaos is having zero predictability or

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,180
control over inputs and outcomes.

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,240
Coming back down the growth rings next to

88
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,100
stagnation is the most desirable

89
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,700
environment,

90
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,700
order.

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,940
Order is knowing that what you do or what

92
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,480
is happening in your environment needs to

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,880
a predictable outcome and in

94
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,400
predictability comfort is found.

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,000
But comfort is also what makes order so

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,660
dangerous because science shows that any

97
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,340
time you continually do something or even

98
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,060
think about something the same way,

99
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,220
you'll eventually stop growing.

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,560
And this applies to every living thing,

101
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,800
even our dog.

102
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
You see, if Aspen had a chance,

103
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,120
she'd choose comfort six days a week and

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,980
twice on Sundays.

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,060
But too much growth limiting order would

106
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,380
have prevented her from becoming a therapy

107
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,740
dog.

108
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Think of the lives this gentle soul would

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,660
not be touching today.

110
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,320
So before your order continues to limit

111
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,780
the way you think and act, remember what I

112
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,320
said earlier,

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
growth only occurs in a state of

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
discomfort. Now think about the power of

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,680
that phrase,

116
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,240
growth only occurs in a state of

117
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,680
discomfort.

118
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,940
I can unequivocally state I wouldn't be

119
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,640
standing on this stage today without my

120
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,700
uncomfortable order disrupting day nine

121
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,260
years ago.

122
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,440
By the way, I'm not recommending you go

123
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,860
get fired to see if it leads to a TED

124
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,660
talk, but when you feel discomfort hit,

125
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,460
that means you've entered the complexity

126
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:16,840
ring.

127
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,100
Complexity is nothing more than changed

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,460
order, but when your order is changed,

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,540
outcomes are no longer predictable and

130
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,960
it's unpredictability that makes you

131
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,580
uncomfortable.

132
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,380
And when most times your visceral response

133
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,960
to discomfort is not just no but hell no,

134
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,740
you can actually learn how empowering it

135
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,820
is to consciously acknowledge discomfort

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,520
and then when appropriate choose

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,440
complexity over order. And I know seeking

138
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,720
discomfort sounds odd and not many people

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,020
do it, but you have to learn to embrace it

140
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,680
because it's the only environment

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,780
sustained or exponential growth can occur.

142
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,520
Okay,

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
to weave high growth complexity

144
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,320
into the fabric of your lives, there are

145
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,780
three primary ways it can be triggered.

146
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,680
Complexity trigger number one

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
is it can be forced upon you.

148
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,960
When I got fired,

149
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,420
I didn't have a chance to stay in order.

150
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,540
Complexity was selected for me. And when

151
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,240
this happens,

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,500
how much you grow?

153
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
Now you respond to it. Now I could have

154
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,420
remained angry,

155
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
I could have used it as an excuse.

156
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,960
But what I actually learned is that I suck

157
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,820
as an employee and I'm much better off

158
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,200
accepting the risks of running my own

159
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,580
company.

160
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
Complexity trigger number two,

161
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,740
someone can help you get there.

162
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,940
This is the role of parents,

163
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,860
teachers,

164
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,600
coaches,

165
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,580
and bosses because left on their own

166
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,820
people will consciously or subconsciously

167
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,340
select the comfort of order.

168
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,660
And they then need to be pushed into

169
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,300
complexity in order to continue growing.

170
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,180
My youngest daughter spent most of her

171
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,120
high school life training to play tennis.

172
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,000
And her coach was pretty familiar with our

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,040
work on complexity and the growth rings.

174
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,260
So I called him up one day to check on

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,600
Maddie's progress and I was able to phrase

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
my question like this. I said, hey, Lee,

177
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
how long has been since Maddie's been

178
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
pushed deep into complexity?

179
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,580
Lee's response.

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,380
Hmm. Funny you'd ask, Bill.

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,780
We got there yesterday.

182
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,260
She broke down into tears on the tennis

183
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,600
court.

184
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:36,980
Well,

185
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,140
knowing how tough my daughter is and the

186
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,060
fact that she never cries told me she was

187
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,020
deep into complexity.

188
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,820
But friends,

189
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,640
this is where critical developmental

190
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,120
decisions are made because the old bill,

191
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,020
the pre -growth ring bill, would have

192
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,140
intervened and wanted to know what was

193
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,560
making her so uncomfortable that I would

194
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
have done everything I could to try and

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
get her happy again.

196
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,320
What I really would have been doing is

197
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,720
removing the complexity and putting her in

198
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,020
order.

199
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,140
I actually would have been stifling her

200
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,240
development. But the new post -growth ring

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,020
bill relished in his daughter's

202
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,460
discomfort.

203
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,080
And it was the coach's next words that

204
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,640
told me everything I needed to hear. He

205
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,220
said, but Billy, I got to tell you,

206
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,360
it took a heck of a lot more to get her to

207
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,940
the limits of complexity this month than

208
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,320
it did last month.

209
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Discomfort was causing her growth.

210
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,020
Okay, but what if you're not lucky enough

211
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,780
to live or work in a robust high -growth

212
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,120
environment? What if you're stuck in

213
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,660
order, even worse, stagnation?

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,860
Well, the great news is everyone can

215
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,440
trigger complexity at any time.

216
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,120
So complexity trigger number three,

217
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,620
trigger it yourself.

218
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,060
Take a journey with me back to Montgomery,

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,040
Alabama in the 1950s. Imagine if you will

220
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,380
a young girl whose black and she attends

221
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,320
an all -black high school. And she takes a

222
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,040
city bus to get there and home, which

223
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,360
wasn't unusual in that era.

224
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,080
And on March 2, 1955, she boards a bus to

225
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,020
come home from school and she sits near

226
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,460
the back in the first row of seats where

227
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,940
blacks were allowed to sit.

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,500
And as the bus continues to fill with

229
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,980
white people,

230
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
there's eventually no more room in the

231
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,160
front of the bus.

232
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,200
And according to local law,

233
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,020
she needed to move further back to create

234
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,840
room for white people to sit.

235
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,300
You see,

236
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,700
Montgomery had an order in place that one

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,060
followed, led to a very predictable

238
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,660
outcome.

239
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,480
Repression of people with little conflict.

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,500
The 15 -year -old Claudette Colvin had just

241
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,860
spent the last month in high school

242
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,780
studying black history. And she was

243
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,460
understandably fed up with the historic

244
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,700
and existing atrocities. And so on this

245
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,120
day,

246
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,080
she decided she didn't like Montgomery's

247
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,300
order.

248
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,580
And by refusing to give up her seat,

249
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
she sent a community,

250
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
our laws, and our entire country into

251
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,460
complexity.

252
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Yes,

253
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,820
nine months before Rosa Parks made her

254
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,320
famous decision to stay put,

255
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,980
it was a 15 -year -old girl that was

256
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,080
handcuffed, dragged from the bus, and

257
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,840
taken to prison.

258
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,240
It was Ms. Colvin, not Rosa Parks who

259
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,360
first fought the law, and by the way,

260
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,220
was also the star plaintiff to testify in

261
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,940
the famous lawsuit that went all the way

262
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,000
to the U. S. Supreme Court.

263
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,060
So,

264
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,720
I use Claudette's actions not to heighten

265
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,120
awareness of race issues,

266
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,640
although that's not necessarily bad.

267
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,680
But I use it as an example of every issue,

268
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,320
of every situation in an ordered

269
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,640
environment. It's a real and perfect

270
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,520
example.

271
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,510
people, our communities, and our courts

272
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,450
into discomfort,

273
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,090
and the downstream impact that can occur

274
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,330
anytime someone elects to move from order.

275
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,650
Dr.

276
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,070
Serene Jones, in a recent book, summarizes

277
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,670
this concept very eloquently.

278
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,850
She said,

279
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,990
the constant facade of order hides the

280
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,930
wilderness that is craving to seep out and

281
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,910
teach us that life wasn't created to be

282
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,990
what we think it is.

283
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,710
Beyond words, we must experience the

284
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,390
wilderness to be taught what cannot be

285
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,050
otherwise known.

286
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,910
So friends,

287
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,870
it's not the discomfort of losing a job.

288
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,290
It's not having a child breakdown on the

289
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,190
tennis courts, but it's order you should

290
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,170
fear the most because it is a threat.

291
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,170
And order disrupting people like Jesus,

292
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,130
Galileo, Claudia Colvin,

293
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,630
Aspen's trainer,

294
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,930
and maybe even a few of you have already

295
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,430
proven, and I think about this,

296
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,470
it's not the complexity triggering

297
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,270
individuals or events you should fear the

298
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,950
most, but it's your own willingness to

299
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,310
accept or seek discomfort that will

300
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,330
dictate the growth of not just you, but

301
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,230
our entire world.

302
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,270
Thank you very much for allowing me to be

303
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,810
a part of this.

304
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,490
Thank you.
