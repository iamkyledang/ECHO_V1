エ ンデ ィ ング

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,080
Good morning.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,960
How are you?

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
It's been great, hasn't it?

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,060
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,160
In fact, I'm leaving.

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,200
There have been three themes, haven't

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,160
there, running through the conference,

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,180
which are relevant to what I want to talk

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,120
about. One is the extraordinary

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,200
evidence of human creativity in all the

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,020
presentations that we've had and in all

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,620
the people here.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,880
Just the variety of it and the range of

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,020
it.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,000
The second is that it's put us in a place

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,360
where we have no idea what's going to

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,440
happen in terms of the future.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,140
No idea how this may play out.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
I have an interest in education.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,640
Actually, what I find is everybody has an

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,420
interest in education,

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,420
don't you?

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,520
I find this very interesting. If you're at

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,220
a dinner party and you say you work in

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,660
education,

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,040
actually, you're not often at dinner

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,000
parties, frankly.

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:27,890
Six 'r died.

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,610
If you're working education, you're not

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,750
asked, you know. And you're never asked

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,090
back curiously, that's the thing that

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,450
strikes me.

34
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,670
But if you are,

35
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,030
and you say to somebody,

36
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,370
what do you do, and you say you're working

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,390
education, you can see the blood run from

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,930
their face. They think, oh my God, you

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,390
know why me?

40
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,950
My one night out all week,

41
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,230
but if you ask people about their

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,590
education they pin you to the wall,

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,350
because it's one of those things that goes

44
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,910
deep with people, am I right,

45
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,630
like religion and money and other things.

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,570
So I have a big interest in education and

47
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,430
I think we all do,

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,490
we have a huge vested interest in it,

49
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,010
partly because it's education.

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,120
SY 'n call a need.

51
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,900
If you think of it, children's starting

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,200
school this year

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,080
will be retiring in 2065.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,040
Nobody has a clue.

55
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,260
Despite all the expertise that's been on

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,560
parade for the past four days,

57
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
what the world will look like in five

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,980
years time.

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,000
And yet we're meant to be educating them

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,320
for it.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
So the unpredictability, I think, is

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,900
extraordinary.

63
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,340
And the third part of this is that we've

64
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,260
all agreed nonetheless

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,880
on the really extraordinary capacities

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,900
that children have.

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
Their capacities for innovation.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,540
I mean, Serena last night was a marvel,

69
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,760
wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do.

70
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,860
And she's exceptional,

71
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,280
but I think she's not,

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,200
so to speak,

73
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,020
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
What you have there is a person of

75
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,200
extraordinary dedication who found a

76
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,420
talent.

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,780
And my contention is all kids have

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,560
tremendous talents and we squander them.

79
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,020
Pretty ruthlessly.

80
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,060
So I want to talk about education and I

81
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,060
want to talk about creativity.

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,220
My contention is that creativity now is as

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,680
important in education as literacy.

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
And we should treat it with the same

85
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,940
status.

86
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,740
Thank you.

87
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,760
That was it. Thank you very much.

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
So 15 minutes left.

89
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,180
Well, I was born. No, the...

90
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,830
I had a great story recently,

91
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,170
I love telling it, of a little girl who

92
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,510
was in a drawing lesson, she was six and

93
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,770
she was at the back drawing and the

94
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,150
teacher said this little girl hardly ever

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,890
paid attention and in this drawing lesson

96
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,410
she did, and the teacher was fascinated,

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,270
she went over to and she said what are you

98
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,370
drawing and the girl said I'm drawing a

99
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,710
picture of God and the teacher said but

100
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,950
nobody knows what God looks like and the

101
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,970
girl said they will in a minute.

102
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,360
When my son was four in England,

103
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,280
actually he was four everywhere to be

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,820
honest, I mean,

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,140
if we're being strict about it, wherever

106
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,200
he went he was four that year, but he was

107
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,120
in the nativity play.

108
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,080
Do you remember the story?

109
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,300
No, it's big, it's a big story.

110
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,560
seen it. I thought it was nativity too.

112
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
James got the part of Joseph, which we

113
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,900
were thrilled about, we consider this to

114
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,960
be one of the lead parts.

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,740
We had the place crammed full of agents

116
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,880
and t -shirts, James Robinson is Joseph.

117
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,620
He didn't have to speak, but do you know

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,820
the bit where the three kings come in?

119
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,120
Now they come in bearing gifts and they

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
bring gold, frankincense and metal. This

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
really happened, we were sitting there and

122
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,620
they, I think, just went out of sequence.

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,620
Because we talked to the little boy

124
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,160
afterward and said,

125
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,400
are you okay with that? And they said,

126
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,100
yeah, why, was that wrong?

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,860
They just switched, I think it was it.

128
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,080
Anyway, the three boys came in,

129
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,860
little four -year -olds with tea towels on

130
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,260
their heads, and they put these boxes

131
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,400
down. The first boy said,

132
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,780
I bring you gold.

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,660
And the second boy said, I bring you mare.

134
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
And the third boy said, Frank sent this.

135
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,070
Ha, ha,

136
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,090
ha, ha, ha.

137
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,830
What these things have in common is that

138
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,830
kids will take a chance.

139
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,490
If they don't know,

140
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,870
they'll have a go.

141
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,450
Am I right?

142
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,310
They're not frightened of being wrong.

143
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,290
Now, I don't mean to say that being wrong

144
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,590
is the same thing as being creative.

145
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,470
What we do know is if you're not prepared

146
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,250
to be wrong,

147
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,710
you will never come up with anything

148
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,150
original.

149
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,090
If you're not prepared to be wrong,

150
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,470
and by the time they get to be adults,

151
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,170
most kids have lost that capacity.

152
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,130
They have become frightened of being

153
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,870
wrong. And we run our companies, this, by

154
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,190
the way, we stigmatize mistakes.

155
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,610
And we're now running national education

156
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,970
systems where mistakes are the worst thing

157
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,450
you can make.

158
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,050
And the result is that we are educating

159
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,090
people out of their creative capacities.

160
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,870
Picasso once said this, he said that all

161
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,410
children are born artists.

162
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,290
The problem is to remain an artist as we

163
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,810
grow up.

164
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,230
I believe this passionately that we don't

165
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,410
grow into creativity,

166
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,010
we grow out of it,

167
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,490
or rather we get educated out of it.

168
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,010
So why is this?

169
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,050
I lived in Stratford on Avon until about

170
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,370
five years ago. In fact, we moved from

171
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,350
Stratford to Los Angeles.

172
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,590
So you can imagine what a seamless

173
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,230
transition this was from.

174
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,830
Actually, we lived in a place called

175
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,710
Satterfield just outside Stratford,

176
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,370
which is where Shakespeare's father was

177
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,570
born.

178
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,450
Are you struck by a new thought I was?

179
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,350
You don't think of Shakespeare having a

180
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,810
father, do you?

181
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,130
Do you?

182
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,010
Because you don't think of Shakespeare

183
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,730
being a child.

184
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,410
Do you? Shakespeare being seven.

185
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,070
I never thought of it.

186
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,750
I mean, he was seven at some point, he was

187
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,270
in somebody's English class, wasn't he?

188
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
How annoying would that be?

189
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,310
really

190
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,450
Must try harder

191
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,630
Being sent to bed by as that to

192
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,610
Shakespeare goes to bed NOW to William

193
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,850
Shakespeare and put the pencil down and

194
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,650
stop speaking like that

195
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,060
It's confusing everybody.

196
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,470
Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los

197
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,430
Angeles, and I just want to say a word

198
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,350
about the transition. My son didn't want

199
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,530
to come, I've got two kids, he's 21 now

200
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,150
and my daughter's 16. He didn't want to

201
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,370
come to Los Angeles, he loved it, but he

202
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,290
had a girlfriend in England.

203
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,930
This was the love of his life,

204
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,250
Sarah, he'd known her for a month.

205
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,090
Mind you, they'd had their fourth

206
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,650
anniversary,

207
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,890
because it's a long time when you're 16.

208
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,830
Anyway, he was really upset on the plane,

209
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,250
he said, I'll never find another girl like

210
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,590
Sarah.

211
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,590
And we were rather pleased about that,

212
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,830
frankly,

213
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,710
because...

214
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,820
Shew's the main reason we're leaving the

215
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,060
country.

216
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,210
But something strikes you when you move to

217
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,630
America and when you travel around the

218
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,770
world, every education system on Earth has

219
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,330
the same hierarchy of subjects.

220
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,610
Everyone doesn't matter where you go, you

221
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,750
think it would be otherwise but it isn't.

222
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,890
At the top are mathematics and languages,

223
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,030
then the humanity is in the bottom of the

224
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,330
arts, everywhere on Earth.

225
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,070
And in pretty much every system too,

226
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,630
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

227
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,990
Art and music are normally given a higher

228
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,650
status in schools than drama and dance.

229
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,950
There isn't an education system on the

230
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,050
planet that teaches dance every day to

231
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,970
children the way we teach them

232
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,350
mathematics.

233
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,190
Why?

234
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,750
Why not?

235
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,690
I think this is rather important.

236
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,750
I think math is very important but so is

237
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,310
dance. Children dance all the time if

238
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,870
they're allowed to, we all do. We all have

239
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,010
bodies, don't we?

240
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,550
Did I miss a meeting? I mean I think...

241
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,770
Truth be what happens is as children grow

242
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,210
up we start to educate them progressively

243
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,030
from the waist up.

244
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,090
And then we focus on their heads and

245
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,990
slightly to one side.

246
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,730
If you were to visit education as an alien

247
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,190
and say what's it for public education,

248
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,230
I think you'd have to conclude if you look

249
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,830
at the output.

250
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,930
Who really succeeds by this? Who does

251
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,590
everything they should?

252
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,530
Who gets all the brownie points?

253
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,370
Who are the winners?

254
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,790
I think you'd have to conclude the whole

255
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,530
purpose of public education throughout the

256
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,950
world is to produce university professors.

257
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,190
Isn't it? They're the people who come out

258
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,610
the top and now I used to be one.

259
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,730
So there.

260
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,410
And I like university professors but we

261
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,130
shouldn't hold them up as the high water

262
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,610
mark of all human achievement. They're

263
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,490
just a form of life.

264
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,830
Another form of life.

265
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,870
But they're rather curious and I say this

266
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,670
out of affection for them.

267
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,330
There's something curious about professors

268
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,610
in my experience, not all of them but

269
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,210
typically they live in their heads.

270
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,650
They live up there and slightly to one

271
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:26,990
side.

272
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,510
They're disembodied in a kind of literal

273
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,170
way. They look upon their body as a form

274
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,510
of transport for their heads.

275
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,250
Don't they?

276
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,250
It's a way of getting their head to

277
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,430
meetings.

278
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,870
If you want real evidence of out -of -body

279
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,070
experiences, by the way, get yourself

280
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,710
along to a residential conference for

281
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,830
senior academics and pop into the

282
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,970
discotheque on the final night.

283
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,110
There you will see it, grown men and women

284
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,110
writhing uncontrollably.

285
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,610
Off the beat

286
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,980
Wait until it ends so that you can go home

287
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,780
and write a paper about it.

288
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,960
Now, our education system is predicated on

289
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,100
the idea of academic ability.

290
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,440
And there's a reason.

291
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
The whole system was invented around the

292
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,180
world. There were no public systems of

293
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,100
education really before the 19th century.

294
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,400
They all came into being to meet the needs

295
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,140
of industrialism.

296
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
So the hierarchy is written on two ideas.

297
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,720
Number one,

298
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,800
that the most useful subjects for work are

299
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,160
at the top.

300
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,540
So you were probably steered benignly away

301
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,720
from things at school. When you were a

302
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,040
kid, things you liked on the ground, you

303
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,380
would never get a job doing that.

304
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,400
Is that right?

305
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't do music, you're not going to be a

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
musician. Don't do art, you won't be an

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,800
artist.

308
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,660
Benign advice,

309
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,020
now profoundly mistaken.

310
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,100
The whole world is engulfed in a

311
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,440
revolution.

312
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,220
And the second is academic ability, which

313
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,620
has really come to dominate our view of

314
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,180
intelligence because the universities

315
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,020
designed the system in their image.

316
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,940
If you think about it, the whole system of

317
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,580
public education around the world is a

318
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,420
protracted process of university entrance.

319
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
And the consequence is that many highly

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,440
talented, brilliant, created people think

321
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,980
they're not.

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,860
Because the thing they were good at

323
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,820
school wasn't valued or was actually

324
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,500
Stigmatized.

325
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,600
And I think we can't afford to go on that

326
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:19,760
way.

327
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,480
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

328
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,260
more people worldwide will be graduating

329
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,760
through education than since the beginning

330
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,400
of history.

331
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,840
More people.

332
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,460
And it's the combination of all the things

333
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,920
we've talked about, technology and its

334
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,840
transformation effect on work and

335
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,860
demography and the huge explosion in

336
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,240
population.

337
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,260
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

338
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,340
Isn't that true?

339
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,460
When I was a student,

340
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,820
if you had a degree, you had a job. If you

341
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,340
didn't have a job, it's because you didn't

342
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,720
want one.

343
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,080
And I didn't want one, frankly.

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,180
But now kids with degrees are often

345
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,980
heading home to carry on playing video

346
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
games because you need an MA, where the

347
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,460
previous job required a BA and now you

348
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,140
need a PhD for the other. It's a process

349
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,280
of academic inflation and it indicates the

350
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,660
whole structure of education is shifting

351
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,340
beneath our feet.

352
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,360
We need to radically rethink our view of

353
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,760
intelligence.

354
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,580
We know three things about intelligence.

355
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,640
One, it's diverse.

356
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,040
We think about the world in all the ways

357
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,380
that we experience it. We think visually,

358
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,760
we think in sound, we think

359
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,420
kinesthetically,

360
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,060
we think in abstract terms, we think in

361
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,320
movement.

362
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,680
Secondly,

363
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,040
intelligence is dynamic.

364
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,060
If you look at the interactions of a human

365
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,420
brain, as we heard yesterday from a number

366
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,020
of presentations,

367
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,700
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

368
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

369
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,040
In fact, creativity, which I define as the

370
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,200
process of having original ideas that have

371
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,620
value,

372
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,300
more often than not, comes about through

373
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
the interaction of different disciplinary

374
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
ways of seeing things.

375
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,400
The brain is intentional. By the way,

376
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,240
there's a shaft of nerves that joins the

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,400
brain,

378
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
called the corpus callosum. It's thicker

379
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,580
in women.

380
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,380
Following on from Helen yesterday, I think

381
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,240
this is probably why women are better at

382
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,840
multitasking.

383
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,080
Because you are, aren't you? There's a

384
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,780
raft of research,

385
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
but I know of my personal life.

386
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,100
If my wife is cooking a meal at home,

387
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,020
which is not often,

388
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,280
thankfully,

389
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,420
you know, if she's...

390
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,650
She's good at some things.

391
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,530
But if she's cooking

392
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,590
She's dealing with people on the phone

393
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,930
she's talking to the kids she's painting

394
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,150
the ceiling You know, she's...

395
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,850
Doing open-heart surgery over here

396
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,290
If I'm cooking, the door is shut The kids

397
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,090
are out the phones on the hook If she

398
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,010
comes in, I get annoyed

399
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,770
I say, Terry please I'm trying to fry an

400
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,790
egg in here You know...

401
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,370
Thank you.

402
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,610
Give me a break?

403
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,370
Do you know that old philosophical thing?

404
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,350
If a tree falls in a forest and nobody

405
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,310
hears it, did it happen?

406
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,750
Remember that old chestnut?

407
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,830
I saw a great t -shirt really recently

408
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,330
which said,

409
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,550
if a man speaks his mind in a forest and

410
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,410
no woman hears him, is he still wrong?

411
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,690
And the third thing about intelligence is

412
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,510
it's distinct.

413
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,370
I'm doing a new book at the moment called

414
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,490
Epiphany, which is based on a series of

415
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,610
interviews with people about how they

416
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,510
discovered their talent.

417
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,690
I'm fascinated by how people got to be

418
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:16,910
there.

419
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,310
It's really prompted by a conversation I

420
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,970
had with a wonderful woman who most people

421
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,210
have never heard of. She's called Gillian

422
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,150
Lynn. Have you heard of her?

423
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,610
Some have.

424
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,450
She's a choreographer and everybody knows

425
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,130
her work. She did Cat and Phantom of the

426
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,470
Opera. She's wonderful. I used to be on

427
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,830
the board of the Royal Ballet in England,

428
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,290
as you can see.

429
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,410
Anyway,

430
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,470
Gillian had lunch on that. I said, how'd

431
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,030
you get to be a dancer?

432
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,870
And she said it was interesting. When she

433
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,230
was at school, she was really hopeless.

434
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,210
The school in the 30s wrote to her parents

435
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,330
and said, we think Gillian has a learning

436
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:46,630
disorder.

437
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,390
You couldn't concentrate. She was

438
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,970
fidgeting. I think now they say she had

439
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,350
ADHD.

440
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,230
Wouldn't you?

441
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,090
But this was the 1930s and ADHD hadn't

442
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,730
been invented at this point. So it wasn't

443
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,190
an available condition. People weren't

444
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,850
aware they could have that.

445
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,650
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

446
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,330
She said this oak panel room and she was

447
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,830
there with her mother. She was led and sat

448
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,910
on this chair at the end. She sat on her

449
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,450
hands for 20 minutes while this man talked

450
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,450
to her mother about all the problems

451
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,430
Gillian was having at school.

452
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,010
At the end of it,

453
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,490
because she was disturbing, people at home

454
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,710
work was always late and so on, a little

455
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,050
kid of eight,

456
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,990
in the end the doctor went and sat next to

457
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,810
Gillian and said, Gillian, I've listened

458
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,770
to all these things that your mother's

459
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,210
told me. I need to speak to her privately.

460
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,390
So she said,

461
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,450
wait here, we'll be back. We won't be very

462
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,330
long and they went and left her.

463
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,930
But as they went out of the room, he

464
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,730
turned on the radio that was sitting on

465
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,130
his desk.

466
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,610
When they got out of the room, he said to

467
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,590
her mother, just stand and watch her.

468
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,710
And the minute they left the room,

469
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,330
she said she was on her feet, moving to

470
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,610
the music.

471
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,790
And they watched for a few minutes and he

472
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,450
turned to her mother and he said, you

473
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:57,970
know, Mrs Lynn,

474
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,510
Gillian isn't sick,

475
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,590
she's a dancer.

476
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,890
Take her to a dance school.

477
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,110
I said, what happened?

478
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,130
He said she did.

479
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,590
I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We

480
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,230
walked in this room and it was full of

481
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,810
people like me.

482
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,110
People who couldn't sit still.

483
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,070
People who had to move to think.

484
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,030
Who had to move to think?

485
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,090
They did ballet,

486
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,050
they did tap, they did jazz, they did

487
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,390
modern, they did contemporary. She was

488
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,590
eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet

489
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,830
School.

490
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,010
She became a soloist. She had a wonderful

491
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,910
career at the Royal Ballet.

492
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,730
She eventually graduated from the Royal

493
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,050
Ballet School, found her own company, the

494
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,050
Gillian Dance Company,

495
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,170
met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been

496
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,290
responsible for some of the successful

497
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,610
musical theater productions in history.

498
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,710
She's given pleasure to millions and she's

499
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,390
a multimillionaire.

500
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,070
Somebody else might have put on medication

501
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,570
and told it to calm down.

514
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,440
have to rethink the fundamental principles

515
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,900
on which we are educating our children.

516
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,340
There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk

517
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,940
who said,

518
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,060
if all the insects were to disappear from

519
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,540
the earth,

520
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,760
within 50 years all life on earth would

521
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,040
end.

522
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,280
If all human beings disappeared from the

523
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,580
earth,

524
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,320
within 50 years all forms of life would

525
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,640
flourish.

526
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
And he's right.

527
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,620
What Ted celebrates is the gift of the

528
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,320
human imagination.

529
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,040
We have to be careful now that we use this

530
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,680
gift wisely

531
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,720
and that we avert some of the scenarios

532
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,420
that we've talked about. And the only way

533
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,580
we'll do it is by seeing our creative

534
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,500
capacities for the richness they are and

535
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,660
seeing our children for the hope that they

536
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:06,880
are.

537
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,240
And our task is to educate their whole

538
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,380
being so they can face this future. By the

539
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,020
way, we may not see this future,

540
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,540
but they will.

541
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
And our job is to help them make something

542
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,660
of it.

543
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,940
Thank you very much.

544
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,470
What if great ideas weren't cherished?

545
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,810
What if they carried no importance?

546
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,550
Or held no value?

547
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,910
There is a place where artistic vision is

548
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,210
protected, where inspired design ideas

549
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,110
live on to become ultimate driving

550
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,770
machines.
