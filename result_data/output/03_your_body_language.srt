1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,180
So, I want to start by offering you a free

2
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,940
no -tech life hack.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,540
And all it requires of you is this, that

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,800
you change your posture for two minutes.

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,620
But before I give it away, I want to ask

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,200
you to right now do a little audit of your

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,840
body and what you're doing with your body.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,620
So, how many of you are sort of making

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,280
yourself smaller? Maybe you're hunching,

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,180
crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,400
ankles. Sometimes we hold on to our arms

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,060
like this,

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,740
sometimes we spread out.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,980
I see you.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,840
So, I want you to pay attention to what

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,120
you're doing right now. We're going to

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,420
come back to that in a few minutes. And

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,060
I'm hoping that if you sort of learn to

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,820
tweak this a little bit, it could

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,860
significantly change the way your life

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
unfolds.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,440
So, we're really fascinated with body

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,860
language.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,160
And we're particularly interested in other

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,200
people's body language.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,400
You know, we're interested in, like,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,120
you know,

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,520
an awkward interaction or a smile or a

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,900
contemptuous glance or maybe a very

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,880
awkward wink or maybe even something like

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,780
a handshake.

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Here they are arriving at number 10 and

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,820
look at this lucky policeman gets to shake

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,380
hands with the president of the United

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,960
States.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,800
Oh, and here comes the prime minister of

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:35,900
the,

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,880
no.

39
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,250
So, um, I hand

40
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,390
of a handshake can have us talking for

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,130
weeks and weeks and weeks, even the BBC

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,990
and the New York Times.

43
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,810
So obviously when we think about nonverbal

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,750
behavior or body language, but we call it

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,210
Nonverbal as social scientists,

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,230
it's language. So we think about

47
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,830
communication.

48
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,750
When we think about communication, we

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,750
think about interactions.

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,550
So what is your body language

51
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,530
communicating to me? What's mine

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,950
communicating to you? And there's a lot of

53
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,690
reason to believe that this is a valid way

54
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,190
to look at this. So social scientists have

55
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,390
spent a lot of time looking at the effects

56
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,870
of our body language or other people's

57
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,970
body language on judgments.

58
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,170
And we make sweeping judgments and

59
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,930
inferences from body language.

60
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,970
And those judgments can predict really

61
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,990
meaningful life outcomes like who we hire

62
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,590
or promote,

63
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,570
who we ask out on a date. For example,

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,080
at Tufts University shows that when people

65
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,780
watch 30 -second soundless clips of real

66
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,580
physician -patient interactions,

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
their judgments of the physician's

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,180
niceness predict whether that

69
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
physician will be sued.

70
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,240
So it doesn't have to do so much with

71
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
whether or not that physician was

72
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,160
incompetent, but do we like that person

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,140
and how they interacted?

74
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,400
Even more dramatic,

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,000
Alex Topologic Princeton has shown us that

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,140
judgments of political candidates faces

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
in just one second predicts 70 % of US

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,220
Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes.

79
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,280
And even, let's go digital,

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,300
emoticons used well in online negotiations

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,280
can lead you to claim more value from that

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,200
negotiation if you use them poorly.

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,240
Bad idea,

84
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:23,880
right?

85
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,220
So when we think of not -

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,140
we judge others, how they judge us, and

87
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,220
what the outcomes are. We tend to forget

88
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,920
though the other audience that's

89
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,020
influenced by our nonverbal, and that's

90
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,580
ourselves.

91
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,840
We are also influenced by our nonverbal,

92
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,580
our thoughts, and our feelings, and our

93
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:40,900
physiology.

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,800
So what nonverbal am I talking about? I'm

95
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,740
a social psychologist,

96
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,340
I study prejudice,

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
and I teach at a competitive business

98
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,460
school. So it was inevitable that I would

99
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,240
become interested in power dynamics.

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,840
I became especially interested in

101
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,460
nonverbal expressions of power and

102
00:03:59,460 --> 00:03:59,880
dominance.

103
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,700
And what are nonverbal expressions of

104
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,740
power and dominance? Well,

105
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,280
this is what they are. So in the animal

106
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,840
kingdom, they are about expanding. So you

107
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,820
make yourself big,

108
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
you stretch out, you take up space, you're

109
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
basically opening up. It's about opening

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,700
up.

111
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,420
And this is true across the animal

112
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,060
kingdom. It's not just limited to

113
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,040
primates, and humans do the same thing.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,700
So they do this both when they have power

115
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,100
sort of chronically, and also when they're

116
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,560
feeling powerful at the moment.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,460
And this one is especially interesting,

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,120
because it really shows us how universal

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
and old these expressions of power are.

120
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,480
This expression, which is known as pride,

121
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,580
Jessica Tracy has studied,

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,440
she shows that people who are born with

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,260
sight and people who are congenitally

124
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
blind do this when they win at a physical

125
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,420
competition. So when they cross the finish

126
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,040
line and they've won, it doesn't matter if

127
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,660
they've never seen anyone do it, they do

128
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,080
this.

129
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,920
So the arms up in the V,

130
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,600
the chin is slightly lifted.

131
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,900
What do we do when we feel powerless? We

132
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,000
do exactly the opposite.

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,740
We close up, we wrap ourselves up, we make

134
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,200
ourselves small. We don't want to bump

135
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,560
into the person next to us. So again, both

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,360
animals and humans do the same thing.

137
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,220
And this is what happens when you put

138
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,520
together.

139
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,350
comes to power is that we complement the

140
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,410
other's nonverbal.

141
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,450
So if someone's being really powerful with

142
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,750
us, we tend to make ourselves smaller. We

143
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,350
don't mirror them, we do the opposite of

144
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,530
them.

145
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,690
So I'm watching this behavior in the

146
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,110
classroom,

147
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,230
and what do I notice? I notice that MBA

148
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,350
students really exhibit the full range of

149
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,150
power nonverbal. So you have people who

150
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,050
are like caricatures of alphas, like

151
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,010
really coming to the room, they get right

152
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,970
into the middle of the room

153
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,170
before class even starts, like they really

154
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,270
want to occupy space.

155
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,630
When they sit down, they're sort of spread

156
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,130
out, they raise their hands like this.

157
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,870
You have other people who are virtually

158
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,850
collapsing when they come in, as soon as

159
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,610
they come in, you see it. You see it on

160
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,570
their faces and their bodies, and they sit

161
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,670
in their chair and they make themselves

162
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,890
tiny, and they go like this when they

163
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,530
raise their hand.

164
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,010
I noticed a couple of things about this.

165
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,490
One, you're not going to be surprised,

166
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,450
it seems to be related to gender.

167
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,990
So, women are much more likely to do this

168
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,930
kind of thing than men.

169
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,190
Women feel chronically less powerful than

170
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,530
men, so this is not surprising.

171
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,250
But the other thing I noticed is that it

172
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,870
also seemed to be related to the extent to

173
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,130
which the students were participating and

174
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,930
how well they were participating, and this

175
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,530
is really important in the MBA classroom

176
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,350
because participation counts for half the

177
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,610
grade.

178
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,870
So,

179
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,090
business schools have been struggling with

180
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,090
this gender grade gap.

181
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,470
You get these equally qualified women and

182
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,230
men coming in,

183
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,610
and then you get these differences in

184
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,990
grades, and it seems to be partly

185
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,370
attributable to participation.

186
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,350
So, I started to wonder,

187
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,550
okay,

188
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,970
so you have these people coming in like

189
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,090
this and they're participating,

190
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,430
is it possible that we could get people to

191
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,490
fake it and would it lead them to

192
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,490
participate more? So,

193
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,850
my main collaborator, Dana Carney,

194
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,370
who's at Berkeley,

195
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,450
and I really wanted to know, can you fake

196
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,430
it till you make it? Like, can you do this

197
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,310
just for a little while

198
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,950
and actually experience a behavioral

199
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,670
outcome that makes you seem more powerful?

200
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,130
So, we know that our nonverbal

201
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,330
govern how other people think and feel

202
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,770
about us. There's a lot of evidence, but

203
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,850
our question really was,

204
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,950
do our nonverbal govern how we think and

205
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,750
feel about ourselves?

206
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,510
There's some evidence that they do. So,

207
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,810
for example,

208
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,790
we smile when we feel happy, but also when

209
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,110
we're forced to smile by holding a pen in

210
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,930
our teeth like this,

211
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,070
it makes us feel happy.

212
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,950
So, it goes both ways.

213
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,430
When it comes to power,

214
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,030
it also goes both ways.

215
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,590
So, when you feel...

216
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,450
to do this, but it's also possible that

217
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,270
when you pretend to be powerful,

218
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,330
you are more likely to actually feel

219
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:01,730
powerful.

220
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,490
So the second question really was,

221
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,110
you know,

222
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,530
so we know that our minds change our

223
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,110
bodies, but is it also true that our

224
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,610
bodies change our minds?

225
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,630
And when I say minds, in the case of the

226
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,950
powerful, what am I talking about?

227
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,910
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

228
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,890
and the sort of physiological things that

229
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,550
make up our thoughts and feelings, and in

230
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,630
my case, that's hormones.

231
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,870
I look at hormones.

232
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,290
So what do the minds of the powerful

233
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,170
versus the powerless look like?

234
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,430
So powerful people tend to be not

235
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,450
surprisingly more assertive and more

236
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:35,970
confident,

237
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,730
more optimistic.

238
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,430
They actually feel that they're going to

239
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,730
win even at games of chance.

240
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,470
They also tend to be able to think more

241
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,930
abstractly. So there are a lot of

242
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,410
differences.

243
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,410
They take more risks. There are a lot of

244
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,950
differences between powerful and powerless

245
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,350
people.

246
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,930
Physiologically,

247
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,250
there are also differences on two key

248
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,590
hormones,

249
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,810
testosterone, which is the dominant

250
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,170
hormone,

251
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,790
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

252
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,670
So what we find is that high -power alpha

253
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,710
males and primate hierarchies have high

254
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,290
testosterone and low cortisol,

255
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,530
and powerful and effective leaders also

256
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,950
have high testosterone and low cortisol.

257
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,290
So what does that mean?

258
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,130
When do you think about power, people

259
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,650
tended to think only about testosterone

260
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,110
because that was about dominance,

261
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,690
but really power is also about how you

262
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,470
react to stress.

263
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,850
So do you want the high -power leader

264
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,530
that's dominant, high on testosterone, but

265
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,710
really stress reactive?

266
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,070
Probably not, right? You want the person

267
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,570
who's powerful and assertive and dominant,

268
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,850
but not very stress reactive, the person

269
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,590
who's laid back.

270
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,890
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

271
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,870
if an alpha needs to take over,

272
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,390
if an individual needs to take over an

273
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,590
alpha role sort of suddenly,

274
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,550
within a few days, that individual's

275
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,230
testosterone has gone up significantly,

276
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,990
and his cortisol has dropped

277
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,590
significantly.

278
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,470
So we have this evidence, both that the

279
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,250
body can shape the mind at least at the

280
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,910
facial level,

281
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,110
and also that role changes can shape the

282
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,410
mind. So what happens, okay, you take a

283
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,090
role change.

284
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,710
What happens if you do that at a really

285
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,910
minimal level, like this tiny

286
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,110
manipulation, this tiny intervention, for

287
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,170
two minutes you say, I want you to stand

288
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,410
like this, and it's going to make you feel

289
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,930
more powerful.

290
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,410
So this is what we did.

291
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,330
We decided to take a role change, and we

292
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,330
decided to take a role change, and we

293
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,330
decided to take

294
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,990
and run a little experiment,

295
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,090
and these people adopted for two

296
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,910
minutes...

297
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,580
high power poses or low power poses. And

298
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm just going to show you five of the poses,

299
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,760
although they took on only two.

300
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,480
So here's one,

301
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
a couple more.

302
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,540
This one has been dubbed the Wonder Woman

303
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,740
by the media.

304
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,800
Here are a couple more.

305
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,000
So you can be standing or you can be

306
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,280
sitting.

307
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,920
And here are the low power poses. So

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,200
you're folding up, you're making yourself

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,640
small.

310
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,100
This one is very low power. When you're

311
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,960
touching your neck, you're really kind of

312
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,720
protecting yourself.

313
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
So this is what happens.

314
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,440
They come in, they spit into a vial.

315
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,940
We, for two minutes, say, you need to do

316
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,520
this or this.

317
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,220
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

318
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,700
We don't want to prime them with a concept

319
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,720
of power. We want them to be feeling

320
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,880
power, right? So two minutes they do this.

321
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,560
We then ask them how powerful do you feel

322
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,820
on a series of items? And then we give

323
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,120
them an opportunity to gamble.

324
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
And then we take another saliva sample.

325
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,540
That's it, that's the whole experiment.

326
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
So this is what we find. Risk tolerance,

327
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,040
which is the gambling.

328
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,820
What we find is that when you're in the

329
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,760
high power pose condition, 86 % of you

330
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,540
will gamble.

331
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,600
When you're in the low power pose

332
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,760
condition, only 60%. And that's a pretty

333
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,960
whopping significant difference.

334
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Here's what we find on testosterone.

335
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,010
High -power people experience about a 20 %

336
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,550
increase,

337
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,310
and low -power people experience about a

338
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,290
10 % decrease.

339
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,410
So again, two minutes, and you get these

340
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,850
changes.

341
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,830
Here's what you get on cortisol.

342
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,770
High -power people experience about a 25 %

343
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:08,770
decrease.

344
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:09,820
increase,

345
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
and the low power people experience about

346
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
a 15 % increase.

347
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,600
So two minutes lead to these hormonal

348
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,000
changes that configure your brain to

349
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,320
basically be either assertive, confident,

350
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,980
and comfortable,

351
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,480
or really stress reactive,

352
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,320
and feeling sort of shut down. And we've

353
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,980
all had that feeling, right?

354
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,300
So it seems that our nonverbal do govern

355
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,260
how we think and feel about ourselves. So

356
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,800
it's not just others, but it's also

357
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,300
ourselves.

358
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,860
Also, our bodies change our minds.

359
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,820
But the next question, of course, is can

360
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,700
power posing for a few minutes really

361
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,820
change your life in meaningful ways? So

362
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,600
this is in the lab. It's this little task.

363
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,980
It's just a couple of minutes.

364
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
Where can you actually apply this, which

365
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
we cared about, of course?

366
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,200
And so we think it's really what matters,

367
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
and where you want to use this, is

368
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,300
evaluative situations like social threat

369
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,080
situations.

370
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,140
Where are you being evaluated, either by

371
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,500
your friends, like for teenagers at the

372
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,280
lunchroom table?

373
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,100
It could be, you know, for some people,

374
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,420
it's speaking at a school board meeting.

375
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,440
It might be giving a pitch, or giving a

376
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,380
talk like this, or doing a job interview.

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,040
We decided that the one that most people

378
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,380
could relate to, because most people had

379
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,560
been through, was the job interview.

380
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,820
So we published these findings, and the

381
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,000
media are all over it, and they say,

382
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,420
okay, so this is what you do when you go

383
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,360
in for the job interview, right?

384
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,060
So we were, of course, horrified, and

385
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,640
said, oh, my God, no, no, no, that's not

386
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,940
what we meant at all for numerous reasons,

387
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,960
no, no, no, don't do that. Again, this is

388
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,860
not about you talking to other people,

389
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,660
it's you talking to yourself. What do you

390
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,460
do before you go into a job interview? You

391
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,000
do this,

392
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,900
right? You're sitting down, you're looking

393
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,960
at your iPhone, or your Android, not

394
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
trying to leave anyone out.

395
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:54,960
You are,

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
you're looking at your notes, you're

397
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,340
hunching up, making yourself small, and

398
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,020
really what you should be doing, maybe, is

399
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,200
this, like in the bathroom,

400
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:01,940
right?

401
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,240
Do that, find two minutes. So that's what

402
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,080
we want to test, okay? So we bring people

403
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
into a lab,

404
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,280
and they do either hire low -power posters

405
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,640
again,

406
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,780
they go through a very stressful job

407
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
interview. It's five minutes long,

408
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,560
they are being recorded, they're being

409
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
judged also,

410
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,040
and the judges

411
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
are trained to give no nonverbal feedback.

412
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,660
So they look like this, like imagine this

413
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,920
is the person interviewing you.

414
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,220
So for five minutes, nothing.

415
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,900
And this is worse than being heckled.

416
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,820
People hate this. It's what Mary Ann

417
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,400
LaFrance calls standing in social

418
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,920
quicksand. So this really spikes your

419
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,280
cortisol.

420
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,260
So this is the job interview we put them

421
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,560
through, because we really wanted to see

422
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,100
what happened.

423
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,220
We then have these coders, look at these

424
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,980
tapes, four of them. They're blind to the

425
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,480
hypothesis,

426
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,360
they're blind to the conditions, they have

427
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
no idea who's been posing in what pose.

428
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,720
And they end up looking at these sets of

429
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,260
tapes and they say, oh, we want to hire

430
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
these people, all the high -power posters,

431
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,900
we don't want to hire these people.

432
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,780
We also evaluate these people much more

433
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,820
positively overall.

434
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,560
But what's driving it?

435
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not about the content of the speech,

436
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
it's about the presence that they're

437
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,740
bringing to the speech. We also, because

438
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,200
we rate them on all these variables

439
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,260
related to sort of competence, like how

440
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,580
well-structured is the speech,

441
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,920
how good is it, what are their

442
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,380
qualifications,

443
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,240
no effect on those things. This is what's

444
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,600
affected,

445
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
these kinds of things.

446
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,200
People are bringing their true selves

447
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,480
basically, they're bringing themselves,

448
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,000
they bring their ideas but as themselves

449
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,520
with no residue over them.

450
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
So this is what's driving the effect or

451
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,580
mediating the effect.

452
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,700
So when I tell people about this,

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
that our bodies change our minds and our

454
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,440
minds can change our behavior and our

455
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,020
behavior can change our outcomes, they say

456
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,300
to me,

457
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,460
I don't, it feels fake, right? So I said,

458
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,240
fake it till you make it, like I don't,

459
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,220
it's not me,

460
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,760
like I don't want to get there and then

461
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,420
still feel like a fraud, I don't want to

462
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,280
feel like an imposter, I don't want to get

463
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,440
there only to feel like I'm not supposed

464
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,100
to be here.

465
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,260
And that really resonated with me because

466
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,860
I want to tell you a little story about

467
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,900
being an imposter and feeling like I'm not

468
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,640
supposed to be here.

469
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,340
When I was 19, I was in a terrible car

470
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,660
accident, I was thrown out of a car,

471
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,760
rolled several times I was thrown from the

472
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,580
car and I woke up in a head injury rehab

473
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,340
ward and I had been withdrawn from college

474
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,000
and I learned that my IQ had dropped by

475
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
two standard deviations

476
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,920
which was very traumatic,

477
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,480
I knew my IQ because I had identified with

478
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,120
being smart and I had been called gifted

479
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,760
as a child.

480
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,420
So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying

481
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,180
to go back, they say you're not going to

482
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,860
finish college, like just, you know,

483
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
there are other things for you to do but

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,320
that's not going to work out for you.

485
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,320
So I really struggled with this and I have

486
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,220
to say having your identity taken from

487
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
you, your core identity and for me, it was

488
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,900
being smart,

489
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,860
having that taken from you, there's

490
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,200
nothing that leaves you feeling more

491
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,120
powerless than that.

492
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,840
So I felt entirely powerless, I worked and

493
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,480
worked and worked and I got lucky and

494
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,700
worked and got lucky and worked.

495
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,840
Eventually I graduated from college,

496
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,260
took me four years longer than my peers

497
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,660
and I convinced someone, my angel advisor,

498
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,280
Susan Fisk, to take me on, and so I ended

499
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,560
up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not

500
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,740
supposed to be here, I am an imposter.

501
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
And the night before my first year

502
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,380
talking, the first year talk at Princeton

503
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,000
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people, that's

504
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,200
it.

505
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,940
I was so afraid of being found out the

506
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,300
next day that I called her and said, I'm

507
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,560
quitting.

508
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,460
She was like, you are not quitting because

509
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,280
I took a gamble on you, and you're staying,

510
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,420
you're going to stay and this is what

511
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,860
you're going to do,

512
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,240
you're going to fake it,

513
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,760
you're going to take, you're going to do

514
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,740
every talk that you ever get asked to do,

515
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,580
you're just going to do it and do it and

516
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,960
do it even if you're terrified and just

517
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,220
paralyzed and having an out of body

518
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,900
experience until you have this moment

519
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,520
where you say,

520
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,500
oh my God.

521
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,030
I have become this, I am actually doing

522
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,970
this. So that's what I did, five years in

523
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,470
grad school.

524
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,950
A few years, I'm at Northwestern, I moved

525
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,430
to Harvard.

526
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,570
I'm at Harvard, I'm not really thinking

527
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,390
about it anymore,

528
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,310
but for a long time I had been thinking,

529
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,950
not supposed to be here, not supposed to

530
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,210
be here.

531
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,530
So the end of my first year at Harvard,

532
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,090
a student who had not

533
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,940
the entire semester who I had said, look,

534
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,580
you have to participate or else you're gonna

535
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,920
fail,

536
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,900
came into my office, I really didn't know

537
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,280
her at all.

538
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,660
And she said,

539
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,780
she came in totally defeated and she said,

540
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,100
I'm not supposed to be here.

541
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,120
And that was the moment for me because two

542
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,780
things happened. One was that I realized,

543
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,860
oh my gosh, I don't feel like that

544
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,840
anymore, you know?

545
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,020
I don't feel that anymore, but she does

546
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,920
and I get that feeling. And the second was

547
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,460
she is supposed to be here.

548
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,820
Like she can fake it, she can become it.

549
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,380
So I was like, yes you are. You are

550
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,200
supposed to be here and tomorrow you're

551
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
going to fake it, you're going to make yourself

552
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,720
powerful and, you know.

553
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,130
go to the classroom and you are going to

554
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,350
give the best comment ever,

555
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,510
you know, and she gave the best comment

556
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,690
ever. And people turned around and they

557
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,290
were like, oh my God, I didn't even notice

558
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,610
her sitting there, you know.

559
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,490
She comes back to me months later and I

560
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,630
realized that she had not just faked it

561
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,730
till she made it, she had actually faked

562
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,370
it till she became it. So she had changed.

563
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,230
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it

564
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,110
till you make it, fake it till you become

565
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,330
it.

566
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,230
You know, it's not done it enough until you

567
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,530
actually become it and internalize. The

568
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,870
last thing I'm going to leave you with is

569
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,130
this,

570
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,510
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

571
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,630
So this is two minutes,

572
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,670
two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

573
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,550
Before you go into the next stressful,

574
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,210
evaluative situation for two minutes, try

575
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,450
doing this in the elevator in a bathroom

576
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,690
stall at your desk behind closed doors.

577
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,490
That's what you want to do. Get, configure

578
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,870
your brain to cope the best in that

579
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,050
situation. Get your testosterone up, get

580
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,870
your cortisol down.

581
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,030
Don't leave that situation feeling like,

582
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,630
oh, I didn't show them who I am.

583
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,710
Leave that situation feeling like, oh, I

584
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,750
really feel like I got to say who I am and

585
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,490
show who I am.

586
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,050
So I want to ask you first,

587
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:16,830
you know,

588
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,170
both to try power posing and also I want

589
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,250
to

590
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,170
the science because this is simple.

591
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,350
I don't have ego involved in this.

592
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,710
Give it away. Like share it with people

593
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,350
because the people who can use it the most

594
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,070
are the ones with no resources and no

595
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,570
technology and no status and no power.

596
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,490
Give it to them because they can do it in

597
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,570
private. They need their bodies, privacy

598
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,970
and two minutes and it can significantly

599
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,570
change the outcomes of their life.

600
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,370
Thank you.

601
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,960
You
