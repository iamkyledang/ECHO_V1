00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,620
About a year ago, I asked my YouTube

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,900
followers to play a simple computer

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,500
programming puzzle that I made with a

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,060
buddy. The object of the puzzle was to get

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,560
your car across the maze by arranging

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,100
these code blocks that represent typical

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
computer programming operations such as

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,700
IFL statements and while loops.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,540
Once you thought you had a good code, you

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,520
would hit run, and your car would move

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,160
based on the commands you had in the

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,540
program.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,540
I asked my YouTube followers to play it

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,680
because I said I wanted to prove that

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,900
anyone from any background could learn to

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,200
code.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,460
50, 000 of them took the challenge and

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,260
attempted the puzzle.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,100
The truth was that I didn't actually care

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,880
about proving that anyone could learn to

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,200
code.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,480
What they didn't know is that we actually

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,180
randomly served up two slightly different

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,400
versions of the puzzle.

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,000
In one version, if you hit run and you

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,440
weren't successful, you didn't lose any of

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
you're starting 200 points.

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,300
We showed you this message.

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,260
However, in the other version, if you hit

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,080
run and again, you weren't successful,

31
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,600
we showed this slightly different message

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,220
stating that you lost five points from

33
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,480
you're starting 200 points.

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,000
That was the only difference.

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,860
In one version, if you failed, we simply

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,800
took away five.

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,320
No value in the real world. No one will

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,540
ever see these completely meaningless fake

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,360
internet points.

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,080
That minor difference is crucial to keep

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,540
in mind for the results I'm about to show

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,680
you from the 50, 000 data points we

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,080
collected.

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,860
For those who were penalized for failed

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,300
attempts,

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,400
their success rate was around 52%.

47
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,040
For those who were not penalized, their

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,740
success rate was 68%.

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
That statistically significant delta of 16

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,340
% was astounding and almost seemed

51
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,180
too hard to believe until we looked at

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,600
another piece of data that we collected,

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,420
which was attempts to solve before finding

54
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,840
success.

55
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,280
It's shown in orange right here. So those

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
who didn't see failing in a negative light

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,340
nearly had two and a half times more

58
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,600
attempts to solve the puzzle.

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,080
As a result, naturally, they saw more

60
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,720
success and therefore learned more.

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
So if you think about that and sort of

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,060
unpack these results,

63
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,420
the trick to learning more and having more

64
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,880
success is finding the right way to frame

65
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,660
the learning process.

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
And this observation seemed really

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,600
profound to me.

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,840
It made me wonder what if you just framed

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
the learning process in such a way that

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,860
you didn't concern yourself with failure?

71
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,360
How much more successful could you be? How

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
much more could you learn?

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,620
And the next thought was that if this is a

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
real effect, clearly there must be some

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,600
evidence for this in real life. It made me

76
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,340
think of toddlers.

77
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,980
It's like, oh boy, I helped make that.

78
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,160
They are constantly trying new things and

79
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,940
they certainly aren't concerned with

80
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,920
failure. When my son learned to walk, he

81
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,620
didn't think about how dumb he might look

82
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,600
if he fell down.

83
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,720
And as his parents, we didn't punish him

84
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
if he wasn't successful either.

85
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
The focus was always on the end goal and

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,620
we celebrated the successes with him.

87
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,680
As a result of constantly failing and

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,800
trying and discovering new things during

89
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,440
that phase of our life, we discover so

90
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,940
many more new capabilities within

91
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,480
ourselves and it's not even close to any

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,460
other time in our life.

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
But maybe using a toddler is sort of

94
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,260
cheating because their brains are

95
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,040
different from ours.

96
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,100
To make the case that perhaps they aren't

97
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,580
that different from us, I'd like to tell

98
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,300
you about a plumber I first met when I was

99
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,860
eight years old. He was Italian.

100
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,060
When Super Mario Brothers came out, my

101
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,860
friends and I became obsessed.

102
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,200
Like we wanted to get to the castle and

103
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,060
rescue the beautiful Princess Peach from

104
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,020
the evil Bowser. We get to school and ask

105
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,580
each other, like, dude, what level did you

106
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,900
make it to? Did you pass the game?

107
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,600
We never asked each other about details on

108
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
all the different ways we might have died.

109
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,720
When it comes to games like this, no one

110
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,060
ever picks up the controller for the first

111
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,100
time and then after jumping into a pit

112
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,960
thinks I'm so ashamed that was such a

113
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,220
failure and they never want to try again,

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,080
right? What really happens is they think,

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,420
oh, I've got to remember, there's a pit

116
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,360
right there. So I think next time I'm

117
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
going to come out with a little more

118
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,480
speed, I'm going to jump a little bit

119
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,740
later.

120
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,440
The focus and obsession is about beating

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,100
the game, not how dumb you might look if

122
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,240
you get hit by a sliding green shell. And

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
as a direct result of that attitude of

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,920
learning from but not being focused on the

125
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,280
failures,

126
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,420
we got perfect and we learned a ton in

127
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,280
a very short amount of time. We were the

128
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
right side of this graph.

129
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
This is what I call the Super Mario

130
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,420
Effect,

131
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,460
focusing on the princess and not the pits

132
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,220
to stick with the task and to learn more.

133
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,060
This caused me to reflect and realize that

134
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,840
there were lots of other examples from my

135
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,300
own personal experience where this

136
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,820
attitude of life gamification,

137
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,420
this Super Mario Effect led to more

138
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,480
success and therefore more learning.

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
So I have a science YouTube channel where

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
I will sometimes use my engineering skills

141
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,660
to build things such as the world's

142
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,960
largest super soaker or the Guinness World

143
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,300
Record world's largest Nerf gun.

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,420
Or maybe this snow ball machine gun.

145
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,980
Yes! This is fashion from a leaf blower.

146
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,300
That's my niece.

147
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,070
Those are my nephews,

148
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,130
I think I figured it out, but when it

149
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,630
comes to me, their uncle, they seem to

150
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,730
have some trust issues.

151
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,590
So these builds usually take me about two

152
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,830
to three months, but there was one that

153
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,050
took me three years.

154
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,590
Basically I wanted to make a dart board

155
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,450
where you could get a bullseye every time.

156
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,490
The idea was that if you throw a dart, we

157
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,970
could like track it through the air, and

158
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,430
then we'd move the board to sort of like

159
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,610
catch a bullseye.

160
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,910
And so once we did the math, we realized

161
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,070
that if we wanted to track the dart for a

162
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,850
typical like game of darts, typical

163
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,410
velocity,

164
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,050
we would basically have to both track the

165
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,790
dart and to move the board the same amount

166
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,430
of time, it takes for a human to blink

167
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,850
once.

168
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,250
No big deal, right?

169
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,210
So I'm not going to bore you with all the

170
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,010
details and the failures and the setbacks

171
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,070
from a lot of metaphorical sliding green

172
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,930
shales and those pesky hammerhead bros,

173
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,550
but eventually we figured out it would

174
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,350
take something that looks like this, which

175
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,730
is six stepper motors and motion

176
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,290
controllers,

177
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,410
a Icon motion capture system with six

178
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,870
cameras,

179
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,550
and just a ton of tweaking and rewriting

180
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,210
the code. But finally, eventually we

181
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,870
arrived here.

182
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,530
what's interesting is when I look back on

183
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,390
that process like I can honestly say my

184
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,390
attitude towards that was the same

185
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,470
attitude I had toward like rescuing the

186
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,970
princess from Bowser like of course each

187
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,810
failure and setback sucked it's stung but

188
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,270
it was no different from like falling in

189
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,950
that pit on level 81 they're like ah you

190
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,390
got to go back to the level and try again

191
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,070
like it was always like okay that sucked

192
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,450
but what did we learn from that like what

193
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,420
can we do next for let's hit it again and

194
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,400
this concept of life gamification is more

195
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,360
than just like have a positive attitude

196
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,060
right or never give up because those sort

197
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,940
of imply you're having to endure against

198
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,700
your true desire to quit I feel like when

199
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,840
you frame a challenge or a learning

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,960
process in the way I'm describing you

201
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,640
actually want to do it is feels natural to

202
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
ignore the failures and try again in the

203
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,320
same way a toddler will want to get up and

204
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,340
try and walk again or in the same way you

205
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,200
want to keep playing Super Mario Brothers

206
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,840
or in the same way the group on the right

207
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,600
had a desire to stick with that puzzle two

208
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,580
and a half time longer they weren't

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,820
getting paid to do that nobody was forcing

210
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,340
them or watching them it was just them on

211
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,820
their computer alone in their house their

212
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,940
outlook made it so they wanted to keep

213
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,260
trying and learning and the icing on the

214
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,900
cake for the dartboard was I took it on

215
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,640
Jimmy Kimmel and challenged him to a game

216
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,660
of darts, and I'll just set this clip up by

217
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,780
saying two things the first is we also had

218
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,420
a mode on the board where if your buddy

219
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,120
had it and through a dart the board would

220
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,300
move the other way and the second is that

221
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,580
we couldn't get this thing working during

222
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,960
rehearsal and it was just barely kind of

223
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,860
creeping along I get up to stand in the

224
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,360
elevator which is the door that moves up

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,320
before you go down out on stage I look to

226
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,740
the right all six cameras had failed so my

227
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
buddy John is feverishly like restarting

228
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,580
all the cameras as I'm going out on the

229
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,660
stage knowing this and there's like four

230
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,940
things and bits and I work up to the

231
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,580
dartboard as the sort of grand finale so

232
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,520
just keep that in mind as this clip starts

233
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,720
like that's where my headspace is three

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,080
freaking years and it comes down to this

235
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,440
moment what you're going to do is you're

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
going to give this start to your buddy okay

237
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,340
challenge him just to like to hit the board

238
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,200
just try to hit the board yeah okay all

239
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
right

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
all right and so then I step up

241
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,140
automatically that's right and you built

242
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,520
this that's right yeah I step up here we

243
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,760
go

244
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,180
Fake it till you make it.

245
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,940
I will say, in all of our testing,

246
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,940
literally, we never had a dead center

247
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,900
bullseye as much as that one right there.

248
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
And so, like, after that, I haven't even

249
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,380
touched the board since. I'm like, I'm so

250
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,960
done with it.

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,440
And I really believe that if you reframe,

252
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,720
like, the challenges, it can make all the

253
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,900
difference. I have a simple thought

254
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,540
experiment to sort of showcase this. Let's

255
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,760
say I gave you a test and it had

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
instructions on it that you would carry

257
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,980
out. And to do that, it had sort of

258
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,820
buttons like this.

259
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,460
And the instructions would say something

260
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,260
like, push button three for five seconds,

261
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,140
and then push button six for one seconds,

262
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,080
then push buttons three and five for six

263
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,800
seconds, and so on.

264
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,300
And unless you carried out the

265
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,340
instructions on page one exactly, you

266
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,020
couldn't see the other 32 pages of the

267
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,260
test.

268
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,040
How much would I have to pay you to take

269
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,980
that test for an hour?

270
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,100
Now, suppose I changed the word test here

271
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,160
to game

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,120
and I rotated this.

273
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,760
And for the input device,

274
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,060
I shrunk the buttons and moved them here,

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
and I gave it a cool paint job.

276
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,960
And maybe different button styles.

277
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,600
And then instead of using words, I

278
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,120
represented the tasks you needed to

279
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,060
accomplish visually like this.

280
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,440
Note the output is the exact same.

281
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,380
You have to push these buttons in a very

282
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,240
specific manner to move on to the next

283
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,880
page or level as it were.

284
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,980
Now picture it's 1986.

285
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,080
How much would you pay me to take this

286
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,000
test just for an hour? If you have a very

287
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,700
bad imagination,

288
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,680
here's a hint to the right answer. I know

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,300
I was there.

290
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:01,980
Nintendo!

291
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,860
Thank you.

292
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Thank you.

293
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,780
Oh, don't come at me, don't play with it.

294
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,000
That has to be the greatest YouTube clip

295
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,740
of all time.

296
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,860
So as a science YouTuber, sometimes I feel

297
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,060
people have framed the act of learning

298
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,320
science negatively. It's been

299
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,840
taught poorly, so it feels scary to them.

300
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,780
It feels something more like this.

301
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,160
And my approach is to take the same

302
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,740
physics lessons you might have hated,

303
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,440
and to try and sort of trick you into

304
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,380
learning something through something cool.

305
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,140
Basically to go from this to this.

306
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,620
So for example, in this video I made a hot

307
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,060
tub with liquefied sand.

308
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,840
And this is another one of my nephews with

309
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,460
unexplained trust issues.

310
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,720
I explained in the video that it's a

311
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,580
fluidized bed. And then we talk about the

312
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,460
principle of buoyancy and how it makes the

313
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,600
whole thing work. And I use several

314
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,080
examples,

315
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
like the blow-dryer with a ping pong ball

316
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,240
like this.

317
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,140
I like to think my approach to science is

318
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,040
similar to velociraptor hunting patterns.

319
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,140
So I get people to come in with something

320
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,160
cool and amazing, like the sand hot tub.

321
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,240
And then when they least expect it,

322
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,620
clever girl.

323
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,500
Admittedly the analogy breaks down a

324
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
a little bit right there at the end.

325
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,780
But by reframing the learning process and

326
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,520
focusing on the cool end goal,

327
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,160
the fear of failure is often taken off the

328
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,900
table and learning just comes more

329
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,320
naturally.

330
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,520
I'll close with this thought.

331
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Someone came up with this cartoon and I

332
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,900
totally love it.

333
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,760
This is so true, but often in life we tell

334
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,420
ourselves

335
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,480
that the top version is what we want.

336
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,400
That's what we expect.

337
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,720
But then something happens. Maybe it's a

338
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,740
really bad grade on a test or a meeting

339
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,480
with a client that goes for a Luring.

340
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,840
Maybe it's a bad breakup.

341
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,540
Maybe we miss a wide open shot. Some kind

342
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,840
of green shell hits you.

343
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,480
And so at that first setback or sign of

344
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
failure, doubt creeps in. We tell

345
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,640
ourselves we're not good enough or we're

346
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,320
not smart enough.

347
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,760
And yet if the bottom rectangle here is a

348
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
game where now your bike's crashed and you

349
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,460
have to get your bike across to the flag,

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,300
it's not, oh, I hit these rocks, I'm just

351
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,940
going to leave my bike here. I'm not good

352
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,020
enough and you quit and walk away. You see

353
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,040
that flag to the right and you're like,

354
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,060
nah, like what did I just learn? You're

355
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,620
like, okay, next time I think I'm gonna

356
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,160
come out with more speed and I'm gonna

357
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,140
lift the front of my bike up. You wanna

358
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,800
try it again. You're immediately excited

359
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,660
to go for it again.

360
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,920
We sort of tell ourselves we want our

361
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,720
life's challenges to look like the top

362
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,940
one, but that's boring.

363
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,400
If that were a real video game or a book

364
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,540
or a movie, that went out to the market.

365
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
It would be a total failure.

366
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,100
Nobody would buy it. Where's the risk and

367
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,540
the reward?

368
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,860
Where's the challenge? There's no feeling

369
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,520
of satisfaction.

370
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,480
The bottom picture is real life and that's

371
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,240
not a bug.

372
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,480
That's a feature.

373
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,240
Think about anything that means anything

374
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,680
to you in life, whether it's a degree, a

375
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,780
relationship with a friend or someone in

376
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,260
your family, maybe professional

377
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,900
accomplishment.

378
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,800
I can guarantee you it came from something

379
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,620
that looks like the bottom and not the

380
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,620
top. Failing and failing and failing and

381
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,580
eventually succeeding to the point that it

382
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,800
now holds value. Just like the most

383
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,860
meaningful high-fives of my adolescence

384
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,360
were those when I said, dude, I finally

385
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,980
beat Bowser last night.

386
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,840
I feel like a lot of the successes in my

387
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,660
life have come down to the Super Mario

388
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,720
effect. And while framing challenges like

389
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,940
this has worked for me, of course results

390
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,900
may vary. Everyone is going to be

391
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,000
different and I don't know exactly what it

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,020
looks like for you to take this principle

393
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,520
and map it into your life. But if we got

394
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,160
these very real results from a very

395
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,120
different cross -section of unique

396
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,600
people,

397
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,140
clearly I'm not alone.

398
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,440
There's some universal principle at play

399
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,740
here.

400
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,360
By shifting your focus to the princess and

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
treating your life's challenges like video

402
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,420
games, you can trick your brain and

403
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,480
actually learn more and see more success.

404
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,500
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,780
Thank you.
