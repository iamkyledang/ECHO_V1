1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,680
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,700
Two years ago,

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,220
my life changed forever.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,980
My wife, Kelsey, and I welcomed our

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,100
daughter, Leila, into the world.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,300
Now becoming a parent is an amazing,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,460
amazing experience. Your whole world

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,220
changes overnight, and all of your

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,100
priorities change immediately. So fast

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,420
that it makes it really difficult to

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,040
process sometimes.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,320
Now, you also have to learn a tremendous

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,020
amount about being a parent. Like, for

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,380
example,

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,220
how to dress your child.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,960
This was new to me.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,460
This is an actual outfit. I thought this

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,240
was a good idea.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,360
And even Leila knows that it's not a good

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,780
idea.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,040
So there was so much to learn and so much

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,300
craziness all at once.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,660
And to add to the craziness,

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,520
Kelsey and I both work from home. We're

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,300
entrepreneurs. We run our own businesses.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,180
So Kelsey develops courses online for yoga

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,500
teachers.

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm an author.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,820
And so I'm working for home. Kelsey's

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,700
working for home. We have an infant.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,120
And we're trying to make sure that

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,840
everything gets done, that needs to be done.

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,080
And life is really, really, really busy.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,320
And a couple of weeks into this amazing

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,220
experience, when the sleep deprivation

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,300
really kicked in, like around week eight,

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,240
I had this thought.

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,520
And it was the same thought that parents

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,320
crossed the ages internationally.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,820
Everybody has had this thought, which is,

41
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,080
I am never going to have free time ever

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,480
again.

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,200
And somebody said it's true.

44
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah, it's not exactly true, but it feels

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,480
really, really true at that moment.

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,180
And this was really disconcerting to me

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,380
because one of the things that I enjoy

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,720
more than anything else is learning new

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,220
things.

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,460
Getting curious about something and diving

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,740
in and fiddling around and learning

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,500
through trial and error and eventually

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,060
becoming pretty good at something.

54
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,880
And without this free time,

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,820
I didn't know how I was ever going to do

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,760
that ever again.

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,220
And so I'm a big geek.

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,860
I want to keep learning things. I want to

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,380
keep growing.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,700
And so what I decided to do was go to the

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,400
library and go to the bookstore. And look

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
at what research says about how we learn

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840
and how we learn quickly.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,600
And I read a bunch of books.

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,140
I read a bunch of websites.

66
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,080
And trying to answer this question, how

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,700
long does it take to acquire a new skill?

68
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,380
You know what I found?

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,580
Ten thousand hours.

70
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,180
Anybody ever heard this?

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,680
Ten thousand. It takes ten thousand hours.

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,300
If you want to learn something new, if you

73
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,480
want to be good at it, it's going to take

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,800
ten thousand hours to get there. And I

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,080
read this in book after book and website

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,900
after website.

77
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,720
And my mental experience of reading all of

78
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,900
this stuff was like, no!

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,400
I don't have time. I don't have ten

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,020
a thousand hours.

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,800
I am never going to be able to learn

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,680
anything new ever again.

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,520
But that's not true. So ten thousand hours

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
just to give you a rough order of

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,380
magnitude. Ten thousand hours is a full

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,920
time job for five years.

87
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,320
That's a long time.

88
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,380
And we've all had the experience of

89
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,000
learning something new. And it didn't take

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,080
us anywhere close to that amount of time,

91
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,300
right?

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,800
So what's up? There's something kind of

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,060
funky going on here. What the research

94
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,160
says and what we expect and have

95
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,660
experiences,

96
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,480
they don't match up.

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
And what I found,

98
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,980
here's the wrinkle. The ten thousand hours

99
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,720
rule came out of studies of expert level

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,620
performance.

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,360
There was a professor at Florida State

102
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
University. His name is Kaye Anders

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,260
Erickson. He's the originator of the ten

104
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,960
thousand-hour rule.

105
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,660
And where that came from is he studied

106
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,380
professional athletes,

107
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,580
world-class musicians,

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,020
chess grandmasters, all of these ultra

109
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,480
competitive folks in ultra-high performing

110
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,700
fields. And he tried to figure out how

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,260
long does it take to get to the top of

112
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,400
those kinds of fields. And what he found

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,560
is the more deliberate practice, the more

114
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,740
time that those individuals spent

115
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,220
practicing the elements, whatever it is

116
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,680
that they do,

117
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,640
the more time you spend, the better you

118
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,860
get. And the folks at the hippy top of

119
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,980
their fields put in around ten thousand

120
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,380
hours of practice.

121
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,820
Now, we're talking about the game of

122
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,180
telephone a little bit earlier.

123
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
Here's what happened.

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,720
An author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,360
wrote a book in 2007 called Outliers, the

126
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,260
story of success.

127
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,320
And the centerpiece of that book was the

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
ten thousand-hour rule.

129
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,160
Practice a lot, practice well,

130
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,760
and you will do extremely well. You reach

131
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,520
the top of your field.

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,480
So the message, what Dr.

133
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,980
Erickson was actually saying is it takes

134
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,700
ten thousand hours to get to the top of an

135
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,380
ultra competitive field in a very narrow

136
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,880
subject.

137
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,800
That's what that means.

138
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,300
But here's what happened. Ever since

139
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,420
Outliers came out,

140
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
immediately came out, reached the top of

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,020
the bestseller list, stayed there for

142
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,900
three solid months.

143
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,860
All of a sudden the ten thousand-hour rule

144
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,080
was everywhere.

145
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,960
And a society wide game of telephone

146
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,040
started to be played.

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,060
So this message, it takes ten thousand

148
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,420
hours to reach the top of an ultra

149
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,480
competitive field became,

150
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,780
it takes ten thousand hours to become an

151
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,380
expert at something.

152
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Which became, it takes ten thousand hours

153
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,220
to become good at something. Which became,

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,280
it takes ten thousand hours to learn

155
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,260
something.

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,480
But that last statement, it takes ten

157
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,640
a thousand hours to learn something,

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,920
it's not true.

159
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,580
It's not true.

160
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,820
So,

161
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,340
what the research actually says, if I

162
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,260
spent a lot of time here at the CSU

163
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,560
library in the cognitive psychology stacks

164
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
because I'm a geek,

165
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,160
and when you actually look at the studies

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,720
of skill acquisition,

167
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,640
you see over and over and over a graph

168
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,140
like this.

169
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,940
Now, researchers, whether they're studying

170
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,680
a motor skill,

171
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,140
something you do physically or a mental

172
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,460
skill,

173
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,900
they like to study things that they can

174
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,460
time,

175
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,300
because you can quantify that, right?

176
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
So, they'll give research participants a

177
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
little task, something that requires

178
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,580
physical arrangement or something that

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,260
requires learning a little mental trick,

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,460
and they'll time how long a participant

181
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,460
takes to complete the skill.

182
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,060
And here's what this graph says. When you

183
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,920
start, so when researchers gave

184
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,640
participants a task, it took them a really

185
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,180
long time because it was new and they were

186
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,560
horrible.

187
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,720
With a little bit of practice,

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
they get better and better and better, and

189
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,820
that early part of practice is really,

190
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,780
really efficient. People get good at

191
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,900
things with just a little bit of practice.

192
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,120
Now, what's interesting to note is that

193
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,700
if, you know, we don't really, for skills

194
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,880
that we want to learn for ourselves,

195
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,020
we don't care so much about time, right?

196
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,020
We just care about how good we are,

197
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,540
whatever good happens to mean.

198
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,400
So, if we relabel performance time to how

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,160
good you are,

200
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,620
the graph flips,

201
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,960
and you get this famous and widely known,

202
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,200
this is the learning curve.

203
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,800
And the story of the learning curve is

204
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,320
when you start,

205
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,900
you're grossly incompetent and you know

206
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,080
it,

207
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,720
right?

208
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,720
With a little bit of practice,

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
you get perfect really quick, so that

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,060
early level of improvement is really fast.

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,400
And then at a certain point, you reach a

212
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,040
plateau and the subsequent gains become

213
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,980
much harder to get. They take more time to

214
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,520
get.

215
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,240
Now,

216
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,120
my question is, I want that,

217
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,100
right?

218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,160
How long does it take from starting

219
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
something and being grossly incompetent

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,900
and knowing it to being reasonably good in

221
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,600
hopefully a short period of time as

222
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:40,960
possible?

223
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,920
So how long does that take?

224
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,640
Here's what my research says,

225
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,860
20 hours,

226
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,820
that's it.

227
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,900
You can go from knowing nothing about any

228
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,120
skill that you can think of.

229
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,300
Want to learn a language?

230
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,140
Want to learn how to draw?

231
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,660
Want to learn how to juggle flaming

232
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,160
chainsaws?

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
If you put 20 hours of focused, deliberate

234
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,100
practice into that thing, you will be

235
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,880
astounded,

236
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,760
astounded at how good you are.

237
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,260
20 hours is doable, that's about 45

238
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,740
minutes a day for about a month, even

239
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,120
skipping a couple of days here and there. 20

240
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,680
hours aren't that hard to accumulate.

241
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,600
Now, there's a method to doing this,

242
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,540
because it's not like you can just start

243
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,120
fiddling around for about 20 hours and

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,260
expect these massive improvements. There's

245
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,060
a way to practice intelligently.

246
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,740
There's a way to practice efficiently that

247
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,940
will make sure that you invest those 20

248
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,320
hours

249
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,160
in the most effective way that you

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,840
possibly can.

251
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
And here's the method, it applies to

252
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:44,960
anything.

253
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,920
The first is to deconstruct the skill,

254
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,060
decide exactly what you want to be able to

255
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,320
do when you're done,

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,600
and then look into the skill and break it

257
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,080
down into smaller and smaller pieces.

258
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,880
Most of the things that we think of as

259
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
skills are actually big bundles of skills

260
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
that require all sorts of different

261
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,300
things. The more you can break apart the

262
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,640
skill,

263
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,580
the more you're able to decide what are

264
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,380
the parts of the skill that will actually

265
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,280
help me get to what I want,

266
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
and then you can practice those first.

267
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,020
And if you practice the most important

268
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,040
things first, you'll be able to improve

269
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,740
your performance

270
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,620
in the least amount of time possible.

271
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,860
The second is learned enough to self

272
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,260
-correct.

273
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,320
So get three to five resources about what

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
it is you're trying to learn, could be

275
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,060
books, could be DVDs, courses, could be

276
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,300
anything,

277
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,040
but don't use those as a way to

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,800
procrastinate on practice. I know I do

279
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,100
this, right?

280
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,140
Get like 20 books about the topic, it's

281
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,960
like, I'm going to start learning how to

282
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,540
program

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,580
a computer when I complete these 20 books.

284
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:57,980
No,

285
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,340
that's procrastination.

286
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,580
What you want to do is learn just enough

287
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,340
that you can actually practice and self

288
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,960
-correct

289
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,980
or self -edit as you practice.

290
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,760
So the learning becomes a way of getting

291
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
better at noticing when you're making a

292
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,740
mistake and then doing something a little

293
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:17,960
different.

294
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,660
The third is to remove barriers to

295
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:22,980
practice,

296
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,340
distractions,

297
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,100
television,

298
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:25,940
internet,

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,700
all of these things that get in the way of

300
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,080
you're actually sitting down and doing the

301
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,300
work.

302
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,800
And the more you're able to use just a

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,500
a little bit of willpower to remove the

304
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,940
distractions that are keeping you from

305
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,300
practicing,

306
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,780
the more likely you are to actually sit

307
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,160
down and practice.

308
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
And the fourth is to practice for at least

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,140
20 hours.

310
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,560
Now, most skills have what I call a

311
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,440
frustration barrier,

312
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,580
you know, the grossly incompetent knowing

313
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,080
its part,

314
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,320
that's really, really frustrating. We

315
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,260
don't like to feel stupid.

316
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,840
And feeling stupid is a barrier to us

317
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,320
actually sitting down and doing the work.

318
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,140
So by pre -committing to practicing

319
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,920
whatever it is that you want to do for at

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,100
least 20 hours,

321
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,060
you will be able to overcome that initial

322
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,700
frustration barrier and stick with the

323
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
practice long enough to actually reap the

324
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,080
rewards,

325
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,660
right? That's it. It's not rocket science.

326
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,820
It's four very simple steps that you can

327
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,940
use to learn anything.

328
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,120
Now, this is easier to talk about in

329
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,400
theory,

330
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,780
but it's more fun to talk about in

331
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,040
practice.

332
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,840
So one of the things that I've wanted to

333
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,720
learn how to do for a long time is play

334
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,220
the ukulele.

335
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,460
As anybody seeing Jake Shimabukuro's TED

336
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,520
Talk where he plays the ukulele and makes

337
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,740
it sounds like he's like a ukulele god.

338
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,060
It's amazing.

339
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,640
It's like, I saw that. It's like, that is

340
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,060
so cool. It's such a neat instrument. I

341
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,440
would really like to learn how to play.

342
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,900
And so I decided that to test this theory,

343
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,680
I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing

344
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,760
the ukulele and see where we got.

345
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,940
And so the first thing about playing the

346
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,540
ukulele is in order to practice,

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,220
you have to have one,

348
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,060
right?

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,440
So I got a ukulele and my lovely

350
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,900
assistant.

351
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,120
Thank you, sir.

352
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,760
I think I need the cord here.

353
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
It's not just a ukulele. It's an electric

354
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
ukulele,

355
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,920
yeah.

356
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,140
So the first couple of hours are just like

357
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,300
the first couple of hours of anything. You

358
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,040
have to get the tools that you're using to

359
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,380
practice. You have to make sure that

360
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,020
they're available.

361
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,220
My ukulele didn't come with strings

362
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,700
attached. I had to figure out how to put

363
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
those on. Like, that's kind of important,

364
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,620
right?

365
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,840
And learning how to tune and learning how

366
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,400
to make sure that all the things that

367
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,020
need to be done in order to start

368
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,060
practicing get done, right?

369
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,280
Now, one of the things when I was ready to

370
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,260
actually start practicing was I looked in

371
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,340
online databases and song books for how to

372
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,680
play songs. And they say, okay,

373
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,360
ukuleles, you can play more than one

374
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
string at a time, so you can play chords.

375
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,740
That's cool. You're accompanying yourself.

376
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,360
Yeah, you.

377
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,560
And when I started looking at songs,

378
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,000
I had a ukulele chord book. They had like

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
hundreds of chords. It was like looking at

380
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
the same thing, like, whoa, that's

381
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,240
intimidating.

382
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,040
But when you look at the actual songs,

383
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,060
you see the same chords over and over,

384
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,740
right?

385
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,340
As it turns out,

386
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,820
playing the ukulele is kind of like doing

387
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,760
anything. There's a very small set of

388
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,480
things that are really important and

389
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,360
techniques that you'll use all the time.

390
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,220
And so in most songs, you'll use four,

391
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,260
maybe five chords, and that's it. That's

392
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,780
the song. You don't have to know the

393
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,640
hundreds as long as you know the four or

394
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:03,980
the five.

395
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,260
So while I was doing my research, I found

396
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,460
a wonderful little medley of pop songs by

397
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,620
a band called Axis of Awesome.

398
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,660
And somebody knows it.

399
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,400
And what Axis of Awesome says is that you

400
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,660
can learn or you can play pretty much any

401
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,460
pop song of the past five decades if you

402
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,780
know four chords. And those chords are G,

403
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,440
D,

404
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,320
D minor,

405
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,020
C.

406
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,900
Four chords pump out every pop song ever,

407
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,380
right?

408
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
So I thought this is cool. I would like to

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,300
play every pop song ever. So that was the

410
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,920
first song I decided to learn and would

411
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
like to actually share it with you. Ready?

412
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,040
All right.

413
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,280
Just a small town girl living in a lonely

414
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,260
world.

415
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,340
She took a midnight train going anywhere.

416
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,180
I heard that you settled down,

417
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,100
that you found a girl, that you're married

418
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,680
now.

419
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,000
Every night in my dreams, I see you, I

420
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,380
feel you. That's just how I know we'll go

421
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,000
on.

422
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,580
I won't hesitate any more, no more, it's

423
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,020
cannot wait, I'm yours, because you are

424
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,920
amazing.

425
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,520
We did amazing things, if I could,

426
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,440
then I would go wherever you were.

427
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,050
Can you feel the love tonight?

428
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,810
Live with or without you

429
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,310
When I find myself, find myself in times

430
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,070
of trouble Mother Mary comes to me

431
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,450
partner no woman no crap I'm on the show

432
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,490
Lee is a dream I come from London under

433
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,550
once a jolly swag man cams by a billabong

434
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,290
hey I just met you and this is crazy

435
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,790
here's my number

436
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,600
Hey

437
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,590
Len he hop, hop, hop, hop long Kai

438
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,230
Long Kai Alright, I'm done

439
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,490
Say goodbye

440
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,390
Closing time

441
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,030
Every new beginning comes from some other

442
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,670
beginnings and

443
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,030
I love that song.

444
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,470
And I have a secret to share with you.

445
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,770
So by playing that song for you,

446
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,130
I just hit my 20th hour of practicing the

447
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,590
ukulele.

448
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,050
Thank you.

449
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,930
And so it's amazing, pretty much anything

450
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,270
that you can think of.

451
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,210
What do you want to do?

452
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,030
The major barrier to learning something

453
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,510
new is not intellectual.

454
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,230
It's not the process of you learning a

455
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,390
bunch of little tips or tricks or things.

456
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,150
The major barrier is emotional.

457
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,910
We're scared.

458
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,950
Feeling stupid doesn't feel good in the

459
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,510
beginning of learning anything new. You

460
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,250
feel really stupid.

461
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,510
So the major barrier is not intellectual.

462
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,270
It's emotional.

463
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,730
But put 20 hours into anything.

464
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,470
Doesn't matter. What do you want to learn?

465
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,170
You want to learn language?

466
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,690
You want to learn how to cook?

467
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,730
You want to learn how to draw?

468
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,850
What turns you on? What lights you up?

469
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,410
Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20

470
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:13,670
hours.

471
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,930
Have fun.

472
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,930
Great job.
