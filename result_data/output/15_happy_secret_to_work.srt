1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,140
What's the millennial question? Apparently

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,900
millennials as a generation, which is a

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,980
group of people who were born

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,660
approximately

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,500
1984 and after,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,720
are tough to manage.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,500
And they're accused of being entitled and

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,560
narcissistic and self-interested,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,260
unfocused,

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,820
lazy,

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,060
but entitled as the big one.

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,840
And because they confound leadership so

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,260
much,

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,900
what's happening is leaders are asking the

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,880
millennials, what do you want? And

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,500
millennials are saying,

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,420
we want to work in a place with purpose,

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,180
love that.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,520
We want to make an impact, you know,

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,420
whatever that means.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,060
We want free food and bean bags.

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,260
And so somebody articulates some sort of

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,900
purpose, there's lots of free food and

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,940
there's bean bags, and yet for some reason

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,620
they are still not happy.

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,340
And that's because there's a missing

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,780
piece.

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,460
What I've learned is that I can break it

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,280
down into four pieces, right? There are

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,740
four things, four characteristics.

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,100
One is parenting,

32
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,220
the other one is technology,

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,380
the third is impatience, and the fourth is

34
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,780
environment.

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,880
The generation that we call the

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,240
millennials, too many of them grew up

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
subject to, not my words,

38
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,800
failed parenting strategies,

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,680
you know,

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,660
where for example they were told that they

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,220
were special all the time.

42
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,040
They were told that they can have anything

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,980
they want in life, just because they want

44
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,160
it.

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,500
They were told,

46
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,160
some of them got into honors classes, not

47
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,340
because they deserved it, but because

48
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,060
their parents complained,

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,920
and some of them got A's not because they

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,580
earned them, but because the teachers

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,040
didn't want to deal with the parents. Some

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
kids got participation medals,

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,680
they got a medal for coming in last,

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,440
right?

55
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,960
Which the science we know is pretty clear,

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,020
which is it devaluing the medal and the

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,660
reward for those who actually work hard,

58
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,180
and that actually makes the person who

59
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,420
comes in last feel embarrassed because

60
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,460
they know they didn't deserve it, so it

61
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,000
actually makes them feel worse, right?

62
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,280
So you take this group of people and they

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,520
graduate school and they get a job and

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,480
they're thrust into the real world, and in

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,620
an instant they find out they're not

66
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,000
special,

67
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,700
their moms can't get them a promotion,

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,760
that you get nothing for coming in last,

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,280
and by the way you can't just have it

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,780
because you want it,

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
right? And in an instant their entire self

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,620
-image is shattered,

73
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,560
and so you have an entire generation

74
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
that's growing up with lower self-esteem

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
than previous generations.

76
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,100
The other problem to compound it is we're

77
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,420
growing up in a Facebook, Instagram world,

78
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,540
in other words we're good at putting

79
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,500
filters on things, we're good at showing

80
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,900
people that life is amazing even though

81
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm depressed,

82
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,260
right?

83
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,140
And so everybody sounds tough, and

84
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,120
everybody sounds like they got it all

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,840
figured out, and the reality is there being

86
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,180
very little toughness and most people

87
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,840
don't have it figured out, and so when the

88
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
more senior people say, well what should

89
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,040
we do, they sound like this is what you

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
gotta do, and they have no clue,

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
right?

92
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,380
So you have an entire generation growing

93
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,540
up with lower self-esteem than previous

94
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,620
generations, right?

95
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,240
Through no fault of their own, through no

96
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,940
fault of their own, right? They were dealt

97
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,760
a bad hand,

98
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,640
right? Now let's add in technology.

99
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,860
We know that engagement with social media

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,720
and our cell phones releases a chemical

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
called dopamine. That's why when you get a

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,140
text, it feels good, right? So you know

103
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,100
we've all had it where you're feeling a

104
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,420
a little bit down or feeling a bit lonely,

105
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,140
and so you send out 10 texts to 10

106
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,260
friends, you know, high, high, high, high,

107
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,620
high,

108
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,140
because it feels good when you get a

109
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,080
response, right?

110
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,620
Right?

111
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,620
It's why we count the likes, it's why we

112
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,160
go back 10 times to see if, and if it's

113
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,700
going, my Instagram is growing slower, I

114
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,960
do something wrong, do they not like me

115
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,460
anymore, right?

116
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,640
The trauma for young kids to be

117
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,940
unfriended, right?

118
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
Because we know when you get it, you get

119
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,220
hit a dopamine, which feels good. It's why

120
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,760
we like it, it's why we keep going back to

121
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,900
it.

122
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,820
Dopamine is the exact same chemical that

123
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,460
makes us feel good when we smoke, when we

124
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,820
drink,

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,340
and when we gamble.

126
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,220
In other words, it's highly, highly

127
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,000
addictive,

128
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:08,960
right?

129
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,200
We have age restrictions on smoking,

130
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,660
gambling,

131
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,200
and alcohol,

132
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,860
and we have no age restrictions on social

133
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,300
media and cell phones, which is the

134
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,860
equivalent of opening up the liquor

135
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,260
cabinet and saying to our teenagers,

136
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
hey, by the way, this adolescence thing,

137
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,840
if it gets you down,

138
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,090
But that's basically what's happening.

139
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,650
That's basically what's happening, right?

140
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,850
That's basically what happened. You have

141
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,830
an entire generation that has access to an

142
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,170
addictive,

143
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,670
numbing chemical codopamine through social

144
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,910
media and cell phones as they're going

145
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,090
through the high stress of adolescence.

146
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,810
Why is this important?

147
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,430
Almost every alcoholic discovered alcohol

148
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,170
when they were teenagers.

149
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,490
When we're very, very young, the only

150
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,290
approval we need is the approval of our

151
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:50,590
parents.

152
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,470
And as we go through adolescence, we make

153
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,290
this transition where we now need the

154
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,850
approval of our peers.

155
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,390
Very frustrating for our parents. Very

156
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,810
important for us. It allows us to

157
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,370
acculturate outside our immediate

158
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,450
families into the broader tribe, right?

159
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,510
It's a highly, highly stressful and

160
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,910
anxious period of our lives. And we're

161
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,230
supposed to learn to rely on our friends.

162
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,930
Some people, quite by accident, discover

163
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,310
alcohol and numbing effects of dopamine to

164
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,170
help them cope with the stresses and

165
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,150
anxieties of adolescence. Unfortunately,

166
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,910
that becomes hardwired in their brains.

167
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,690
And for the rest of their lives, when they

168
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,290
suffer significant stress, they will not

169
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,190
turn to a person, they will turn to the

170
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,610
bottle.

171
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,850
Social stress, financial stress, career

172
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,510
stress. That's pretty much the primary

173
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,490
reasons why an alcoholic drinks, right?

174
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,110
What's happening is because we're allowing

175
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,130
unfettered access to this dopamine

176
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,110
producing devices and media,

177
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,110
basically it's becoming hardwired. And

178
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,510
what we're seeing is as they grow older,

179
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,950
they too many kids don't know how to form

180
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,110
deep meaningful relationships.

181
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,710
Their words, not mine. They will admit

182
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,150
that many of their friendships are

183
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,510
superficial.

184
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,250
They will admit that their friends, that

185
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,830
they don't count on their friends, they

186
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,030
don't rely on their friends, they have fun

187
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,670
with their friends.

188
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,790
But they also know that their friends will

189
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,230
cancel on them if something better comes

190
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,930
along. Deep meaningful relationships are

191
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,790
not there because they never practice the

192
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,010
skill set. And worse,

193
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,890
they don't have the coping mechanisms to

194
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,770
deal with stress. So when significant

195
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,470
stress starts to show up in their lives,

196
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,950
they're not turning to a person,

197
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,430
they're turning to a device,

198
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,110
they're turning to social media,

199
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,810
they're turning to these things which

200
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,010
offer temporary relief. We know, the

201
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,970
science is clear, we know that people who

202
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,530
spend more time on Facebook suffer higher

203
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,670
rates of depression than people who spend

204
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,470
less time on Facebook.

205
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,090
These things balance, alcohol is not bad,

206
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,370
too much alcohol is bad. Gambling is fun,

207
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,010
too much gambling is dangerous.

208
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,150
There's nothing wrong with social media

209
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,730
and cell phones. It's the imbalance.

210
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,390
If you're sitting at dinner with your

211
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,870
friends

212
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,870
and you're texting somebody who's not

213
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,250
there,

214
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,710
that's a problem, that's an addiction.

215
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,370
If you're sitting in a meeting

216
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,890
with people, you're supposed to be

217
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,250
listening to and speaking and you put your

218
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,570
phone on the table,

219
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,150
face up or face down, I don't care,

220
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,570
that sends a subconscious message to the

221
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,450
room that you're just not that important

222
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,270
to me right now.

223
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,730
That's what happens.

224
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,530
And the fact that you cannot put it away

225
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,630
is because you are addicted.

226
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,850
If you wake up and you check your phone

227
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,330
before you say good morning to your

228
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,170
girlfriend, boyfriend or spouse, you have

229
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,670
an addiction.

230
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,030
And like all addiction, in time, it'll

231
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,970
destroy relationships,

232
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,810
it'll cost time and it'll cost money and

233
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,910
it'll make your life worse,

234
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,050
right?

235
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,630
So you have a generation growing up with

236
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,150
lower self-esteem that doesn't have the

237
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,450
coping mechanisms to do with stress,

238
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,050
right? Now you add in the sense of

239
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,510
impatience,

240
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,030
right? They've grown up in a world of

241
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,870
instant gratification.

242
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,510
You want to buy something, you go on Amazon,

243
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,550
it arrives the next day.

244
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,470
You want to watch a movie? Log on and watch

245
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,130
a movie, you don't check movie times. You

246
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,890
want to watch a TV show? Binge, you don't

247
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,690
even have to wait week to week,

248
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,470
right?

249
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,730
I know people who skip seasons just so

250
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,210
they can binge at the end of the season,

251
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:44,950
right?

252
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,430
Instant gratification.

253
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,470
Instant gratification. You want to go on a

254
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:49,750
date?

255
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,790
You don't even have to learn how to be

256
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,610
like, hey.

257
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,210
Hey.

258
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,280
You don't even have to learn and pray.

259
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,640
You don't have to be the uncomfortable on

260
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,260
what's his yes when you mean no and says

261
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,860
no, when you mean no, but yes when you, you

262
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,520
don't have to swipe right. Bang, I'm a

263
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,780
stud.

264
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,200
Right? You don't have to learn

265
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,960
the social coping mechanisms, right?

266
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,120
Everything you want, you can have

267
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,880
instantaneously.

268
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,400
Everything you want.

269
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,740
Instant gratification.

270
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,540
Except job satisfaction

271
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,300
and strength of relationships,

272
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,380
there ain't no app for that. They are

273
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,040
slow,

274
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,940
meandering, uncomfortable, messy

275
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,460
processes.

276
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,880
And so I keep meeting these wonderful,

277
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,140
fantastic, idealistic, hard -working,

278
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,640
smart kids. They've just graduated from school.

279
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,640
They're in their entry -level job. I sit

280
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,980
down with them when I go, how's it going?

281
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,480
They go, I think I'm going to quit.

282
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm like, why?

283
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
They're like, I'm not making an impact.

284
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm like, you've been here eight months.

285
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,740
You know?

286
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,360
It's as if they're standing at the foot of

287
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,660
a mountain

288
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,300
and they have this abstract concept called

289
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,720
impact that they want to have in the world,

290
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,180
which is the summit. What they don't see

291
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,600
is the mountain.

292
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,820
I don't care if you go up the mountain

293
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,320
quickly or slowly, but there's still a

294
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,560
mountain.

295
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,180
And so what this young generation needs to

296
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,340
learn is patience.

297
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,940
That some things that really, really

298
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,400
matter,

299
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,360
like love or job fulfillment,

300
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,320
joy,

301
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,880
love of life, self-confidence,

302
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,000
a skill set, any of these things, all of

303
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,220
these things take time.

304
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,440
Sometimes you can expedite pieces of it,

305
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,340
but the overall journey is arduous and

306
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,980
long and difficult.

307
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,900
And if you don't ask for help and learn

308
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,500
that skill set,

309
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
you will fall off the mountain, or you

310
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,940
will, the worst case scenario, the worst

311
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,540
case scenario, and we're already seeing

312
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,160
it. The worst case scenario is we're

313
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,480
seeing increase in suicide rates.

314
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,140
We're seeing an increase in this

315
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,440
generation. We're seeing an increase in

316
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
accidental deaths due to drug overdoses.

317
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,500
We're seeing more and more kids drop out

318
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
of school or take leaves of absence due to

319
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,020
depression,

320
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,520
unheard of.

321
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,340
This is terrible.

322
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,920
The best case scenario,

323
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
those are all bad cases, right?

324
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,260
The best case scenario is you'll have an

325
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,120
entire population

326
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,060
growing up and going through life and just

327
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,780
never really finding joy.

328
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,560
They'll never really find deep, deep

329
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
fulfillment in work or in life. They'll

330
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,100
just waft through life and it'll be just,

331
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,160
it's fine.

332
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,560
How's your job?

333
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,360
It's fine,

334
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,420
same as yesterday.

335
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
How's your relationship? It's fine.

336
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,160
Like that's the best case scenario, which

337
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,660
leads me to the fourth point, which is

338
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,520
environment, which are we're taking this

339
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,880
amazing group of young, fantastic kids who

340
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,760
are just dealt a bad hand. It's no fault

341
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,260
of their own.

342
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
And we put them in corporate environments

343
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,360
that care more about the numbers than they

344
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,100
do about the kids.

345
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,480
They care more about the short -term gains

346
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,320
than the long -term life of this young

347
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,180
human being. We care more about the year

348
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,380
than the lifetime,

349
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
right? And so we are putting them in

350
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,220
corporate environments that aren't helping

351
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,000
them build their confidence, that aren't

352
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,420
helping them learn the skills of

353
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,840
cooperation,

354
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,640
that aren't helping them overcome the

355
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,580
challenges of a digital world and finding

356
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,660
more balance

357
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,460
that isn't helping them overcome the need

358
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,060
to have instant gratification and teach

359
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,140
them the joys and impact and the

360
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,560
fulfillment you get from working hard on

361
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
something for a long time that cannot be

362
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,680
done in a month or even in a year.

363
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
And so we're thrusting them in corporate

364
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,180
environments and the worst part about it

365
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,840
does they think it's them?

366
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,160
They blame themselves.

367
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
They think it's them who can't deal.

368
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
And so it makes it all worse.

369
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,100
It's not, I'm here to tell them, it's not

370
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,380
them.

371
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,620
It's the corporations, it's the corporate

372
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,260
environments. It's the total lack of good

373
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,840
leadership in our world today that is

374
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,040
making them feel the way they do.

375
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,880
They would deal a bad hand, and it's, and

376
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
I hate to say it, but it's the company's

377
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,760
responsibility. Sucks to be you, like we

378
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,640
have no choice, right? This is what we got

379
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
and I wish that society and their parents

380
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,660
did a better job, they didn't. So we're

381
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,100
getting them in our companies and we now

382
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,880
have to pick up the slack. We have to work

383
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,620
extra hard to figure out the ways that we

384
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,200
build their confidence. We have to work

385
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,980
extra hard to find ways to teach them the

386
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,660
social skills that they're missing out on.

387
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,060
There should be no cell phones in

388
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,640
conference rooms.

389
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,960
None, zero.

390
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,060
And I don't mean the kind of like sitting

391
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,140
outside waiting to text. I mean like when

392
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
you're sitting and waiting for a meeting

393
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,580
to start,

394
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,540
nobody go, this is what we all do. We all

395
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,480
sit here and wait for the meeting to

396
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,660
start.

397
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,060
Meeting starting, okay,

398
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,260
and we start the meeting. No, that's not

399
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,820
how relationships are formed. Remember we

400
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,980
talked about it's the little things?

401
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,840
Relationships are formed this way. We're

402
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,980
waiting for a meeting to start and we go,

403
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
how's your dad, I heard he was in the

404
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,340
hospital.

405
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,300
Oh, he's perfect, thanks for asking.

406
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,340
He's actually at home now. Oh, I'm really

407
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,300
glad, that was really amazing.

408
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,960
I know it was terrifying for a while.

409
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,720
That's how you form relationships.

410
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,640
Hey, did you ever get that report on, oh

411
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,440
my God, no I didn't. I'll help you out, I

412
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,900
totally, can I help you out with that?

413
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,300
Really?

414
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,320
That's how trust forms.

415
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,940
Trust doesn't form at an event in a day.

416
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,440
Even bad times don't form trust

417
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,060
immediately. It's the slow, steady

418
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,980
consistency.

419
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,120
And we have to create mechanisms where we

420
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,740
allow

421
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,540
for those little innocuous interactions to

422
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,220
happen. But when we allow cell phones in

423
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,820
conference rooms, we just, okay, have the

424
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:07,980
meeting.

425
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,900
And then my favorite is when there's a

426
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,280
cell phone there and you go like this, you

427
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,400
go,

428
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,580
it rings and you go,

429
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm not going to answer that.

430
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,060
Mr. Magnanimous, you know?

431
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,760
When you're out for dinner with your

432
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,520
friends, like,

433
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
I do this with my friends. When we're

434
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,280
going out for dinner and we're leaving

435
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,660
together,

436
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,060
we'll leave our cell phones at home.

437
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,960
Who are we calling? Maybe one of us will

438
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
bring a phone in case we need to call an

439
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Uber or take a picture of our meal.

440
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,810
I mean, I'm not, I'm an idealist, but I'm

441
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,830
not insane, you know,

442
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:47,990
how to even,

443
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,770
I mean, it looked perfect.

444
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,110
We'll take one phone.

445
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,070
And so it's like an alcoholic. The reason

446
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,070
you take the alcohol out of the house is

447
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,970
because we cannot trust our willpower.

448
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,650
We're just not strong enough. But when you

449
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,710
remove the temptation,

450
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,890
it actually makes it a lot easier.

451
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,810
And so when you just say, don't check your

452
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,270
phone, people literally will go like this,

453
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,610
and somebody will go to the bathroom and

454
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,550
what's the first thing we do?

455
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,550
Because I wouldn't want to look around the

456
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,910
restaurant for a minute and a half, you

457
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,830
know? But if you don't have the phone, you

458
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,090
just kind of enjoy the world. And that's

459
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,010
where ideas happen.

460
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,650
The constant, constant, constant

461
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,650
engagement is not where you have

462
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,570
innovation and ideas.

463
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,650
Ideas happen when our minds wander and we

464
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:26,790
go,

465
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,510
and you see something, I bet they could do

466
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:29,770
that.

467
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,410
That's called innovation,

468
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,290
right? But we're taking away all those

469
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,830
little moments,

470
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,690
right?

471
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,010
You should not, and none of us, none of us

472
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,610
should charge our phones by our beds. We

473
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,570
should be charging our phones in the

474
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,010
living rooms,

475
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:40,730
right?

476
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,670
Remove the temptation. You wake up in the

477
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,390
middle of the night because you can't

478
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,570
sleep.

479
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,030
You won't check your phone, which makes it

480
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,250
worse.

481
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,770
But if it's in the living room,

482
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,170
it's relaxed. It's fine.

483
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,390
But it's my alarm clock.

484
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,710
Buy an alarm clock.

485
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,350
It costs eight dollars.

486
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,650
I'll buy you an alarm clock.
