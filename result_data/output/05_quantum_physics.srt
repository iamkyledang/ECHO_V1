1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,840
I grew up to study the brain because I

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,060
have a brother who has been diagnosed with

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,620
a brain disorder schizophrenia.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,800
And as a sister and later as a scientist,

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,200
I wanted to understand why is it that I

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,640
can take my dreams,

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,820
I can connect them to my reality, and I

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,600
can make my dreams come true. What is it

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
about my brother's brain and his

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,480
schizophrenia that he cannot connect his

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,180
dreams to a common and shared reality so

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,120
they instead become delusion?

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,560
So I dedicated my career to research into

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,440
the severe mental illnesses and I moved

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,480
from my home state of Indiana to Boston

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,400
where I was working in the lab of Dr.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
Francine Bene's

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,940
And in the lab, we were asking the

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,380
question,

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,760
what are the biological differences

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,240
between the brains of individuals who

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,200
would be diagnosed as normal control,

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,780
as compared with the brains of individuals

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,240
diagnosed with schizophrenia,

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,200
schizoaffective, or bipolar disorder?

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,300
So we were essentially mapping the

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
microcircuitry of the brain, which cells

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,920
are communicating with which cells, with

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,660
which chemicals,

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,220
and then in what quantities of those

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,740
chemicals.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,600
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
because I was performing this type of

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,040
research during the day, but then in the

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,900
evenings and on the weekends, I traveled

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,280
as an advocate for NAME, the National

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,300
Alliance on Mental Illness.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,360
But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,500
woke up to discover that I had a brain

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,100
disorder of my own.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,660
A blood vessel exploded in the left half

43
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,600
of my brain.

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,880
And in the course of four hours, I watched

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,260
my brain completely

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,660
deteriorate in its ability to process all

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,380
information.

48
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,080
On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,640
not walk,

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,340
talk,

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,080
read,

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,280
write, or recall any of my life.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,100
I essentially became an infant in a

54
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,860
woman's body.

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
If you've ever seen a human brain,

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,860
it's

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Demo spheres are completely separate from

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,260
one another and I have brought for you a

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,180
real human brain

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,380
So this is a real human brain

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,020
This is the front of the brain the back of

62
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,080
the brain with a spinal cord hanging down

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,420
And this is how it would be positioned

64
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,340
inside of my head and

65
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,440
When you look at the brain, it's obvious

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,100
that the two cerebral courtesies are

67
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,040
completely separate from one another

68
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,960
For those of you who understand computers

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
our right hemisphere functions like a

70
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
parallel processor While our left

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,920
hemisphere functions like a serial

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,680
processor

73
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,800
The two hemispheres do communicate with

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,820
one another through the corpus callosum,

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,540
which is made up of some 300 million

76
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,540
axonal fibers, but other than that the two

77
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,780
hemispheres are completely separate

78
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,300
Because they process information

79
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,680
differently each of our hemisphere think

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,100
about different things They care about

81
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,340
different things and dare I say they have

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,820
very different personalities

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,160
Excuse me, thank you.

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,900
It's been a joy

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,500
Our right human hemisphere is all about

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,980
this present moment It's all about right

87
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,400
here right now our right hemisphere It

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,820
thinks in pictures and it learns

89
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,220
kinesthetically through the movement of

90
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,020
our bodies

91
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,120
Information in the form of energy streams

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,640
in simultaneously through all of our

93
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,060
systems and then it explodes into this

94
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,740
enormous collage of what this present

95
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,900
moment looks like,

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,120
what this present moment smells like and

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,900
tastes like,

98
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,200
what it feels like, and what it sounds

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,660
like.

100
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,400
I am an energy being connected to the

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,360
energy all around me through the

102
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,620
consciousness of my right hemisphere.

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,060
We are energy beings connected to one

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,780
another through the consciousness of our

105
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,020
right hemispheres as one human family.

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,760
And right here, right now,

107
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,340
we are brothers and sisters on this planet

108
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,180
here to make the world a better place. And

109
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,400
at this moment, we are perfect,

110
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,820
we are whole,

111
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,440
and we are beautiful.

112
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,960
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,620
is a very different place.

114
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,500
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,340
methodically.

116
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,360
Our left hemisphere is all about the past

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,880
and it's all about the future.

118
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

119
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,960
that enormous collage of the present

120
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,360
moment and start picking out details,

121
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,080
details,

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,380
and more details about those details.

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,900
It then categorizes and organizes all that

124
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,560
information,

125
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,700
associates it with everything in the past

126
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,200
we've ever learned, and projects into the

127
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,360
future all of our possibilities.

128
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,000
And our left hemisphere thinks in

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,540
language.

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
It's that ongoing brain chatter that

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,820
connects me and my internal world to my

132
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,800
external world.

133
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,380
It's that little voice that says to me,

134
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,400
hey,

135
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
you've got to remember to pick up bananas

136
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
on your way home.

137
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,880
I need them in the morning.

138
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,500
It's that calculating intelligence that

139
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,740
knows, that reminds me, when I have to do

140
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,280
my laundry.

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,580
But perhaps most important,

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,040
it's that little voice that says to me,

143
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,800
I am,

144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,960
I am.

145
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,000
And as soon as my left hemisphere says to

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,060
me, I am.

147
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,810
separate I become a single solid

148
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,010
individual separate from the energy flow

149
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,350
around me and separate from you and this

150
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,990
is the portion of my brain that I lost on

151
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,650
the morning of my stroke in the morning of

152
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,690
the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain

153
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,190
behind my left eye and it was the kind of

154
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,310
pain caustic pain that you get when you

155
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,190
bite into ice cream

156
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,390
it just gripped me,

157
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,350
and then it released me.

158
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,670
And then it just gripped me, and then it

159
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,330
released me.

160
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,790
And it was very unusual for me to ever

161
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,390
experience any kind of pain, so I thought,

162
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,110
okay, I'll just start my normal routine.

163
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,890
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio

164
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,990
glider, which is a full body, full

165
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,170
exercise machine.

166
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,990
And I'm jamming away on this thing, and

167
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,990
I'm realizing that my hands look like

168
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,390
primitive claws grasping onto the bar.

169
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,930
And I thought that's very peculiar, and I

170
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,990
looked down at my body, and I thought,

171
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,930
whoa, I'm a weird looking thing.

172
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,150
And it was as though my consciousness had

173
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,510
shifted away from my normal perception of

174
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,930
reality, where I'm the person on the

175
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,230
machine having the experience to some

176
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,770
esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself

177
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,150
having this experience.

178
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,670
And it was all very peculiar, and my

179
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,210
headache was just getting worse, so I get

180
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,890
off the machine, and I'm walking across my

181
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,870
living room floor, and I realize that

182
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,210
everything inside my body has slowed

183
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,430
way down,

184
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,570
and every step is very rigid and very

185
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,350
deliberate. There's no fluidity to my

186
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,610
pace, and there's this constriction into

187
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,210
my area of perception, so I'm just focused

188
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,610
on internal systems.

189
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,970
And I'm standing in my bathroom, getting

190
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,030
ready to step into the shower, and I could

191
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,370
actually hear the dialogue inside my

192
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,510
body. I heard a little voice saying, okay,

193
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,490
you muscles, you have to contract, and you

194
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,590
muscles, you relax. And then I lost my

195
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,670
balance, and I'm propped up against the

196
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,290
wall,

197
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,530
and I looked down at my arm,

198
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,550
and I realized that I can no longer define

199
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,110
the boundaries of my body.

200
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,550
I can't define where I begin and where I

201
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,810
end, because the atoms and the molecules

202
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,030
of my arm blended with the atoms.

203
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,120
molecules of the wall and all I could

204
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,840
detect was this energy, energy and I'm

205
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,040
asking myself what is wrong with me, what

206
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,100
is going on and at that moment my brain

207
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,940
chatter, my left hemisphere brain chatter

208
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,000
went totally silent just like someone took

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
a remote control and pushed the mute

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,640
button,

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
total silence and at first I was shocked

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,840
to find myself inside a silent mind but

213
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,260
then I was immediately captivated by the

214
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,000
magnificence of the energy around me and

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
because I could no longer identify the

216
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,640
boundaries of my body I felt enormous and

217
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,700
expansive,

218
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,940
I felt at one with all the energy that was

219
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,300
and it was beautiful there and then all of

220
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,820
a sudden my left hemisphere comes back

221
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,180
online and it says to me, hey we got a

222
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,320
problem

223
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,880
We've got to get some help, and I'm going,

224
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,660
oh, I've got a problem, I've got a

225
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,020
problem.

226
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,640
I got a problem, but then I immediately

227
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,520
drifted right back out into the

228
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,060
consciousness,

229
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,780
and I affectionately refer to this space

230
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,200
as La La Land.

231
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,540
But it was beautiful there. Imagine what

232
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,880
it would be like to be totally

233
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
disconnected from your brain chatter that

234
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,980
connects you to the external world.

235
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,920
So here I am in this space, and my job,

236
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,560
and any stress related to my job, it was

237
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,360
gone. And I felt lighter in my body.

238
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,400
And imagine all the relationships in

239
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,220
the external world, and any stressors

240
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,980
related to any of those, they were gone.

241
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,160
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

242
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,260
And imagine what it would feel like to

243
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,120
lose 37 years of emotional baggage.

244
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,820
Oh,

245
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,860
I felt euphoria,

246
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,380
euphoria.

247
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,880
It was beautiful there. And then again, my

248
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
left hemisphere comes online.

249
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,410
to pay attention.

250
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,310
We've got to get help and I'm thinking

251
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,750
I've got to get help. I've got to focus.

252
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,850
So I get out of the shower and I'm

253
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,210
mechanically dressed and I'm walking

254
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,130
around my apartment and I'm thinking I've

255
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,290
got to get to work. I've got to get to

256
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,550
work.

257
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,990
Can I drive?

258
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,690
Can I drive? And at that moment my right

259
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,610
arm went totally paralyzed by my side.

260
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,390
Then I realize, oh my gosh, I'm having a

261
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,790
stroke.

262
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,990
I'm having a stroke. And then the next

263
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,410
thing my brain says to me is,

264
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,410
wow,

265
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,030
this is so cool.

266
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,010
This is so cool.

267
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,030
How many brain scientists have the

268
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,290
opportunity to study their own brain from

269
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,250
the inside out?

270
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,050
But I'm a very busy woman

271
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,100
to strong from happening so I'll do this

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,440
for a week or two and then I'll get back

273
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,900
to my routine.

274
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,270
I got to call work. I could remember the

275
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,530
number at work. So I remembered in my

276
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,310
office I had a business card with my

277
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,490
number on it. So I go into my business

278
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,790
room and pull out a three -inch stack of

279
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,030
business cards and I'm looking at the card

280
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,090
on top and even though I could see clearly

281
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,990
in my mind's eye what my business card

282
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,410
looked like, I couldn't tell if this was

283
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,830
my card or not because all I could see

284
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,510
were pixels and the pixels of the words

285
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,730
blended with the pixels of the background

286
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,450
and the pixels of the symbols and I just

287
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,650
couldn't tell and then I would wait for

288
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,430
what I call a wave of clarity and in that

289
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,830
moment I would be able to reattach to

290
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,610
normal reality and I could tell that's not

291
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,510
the card, that's not the card, that's not

292
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,330
the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one

293
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,770
inch down inside that stack of cards.

294
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,310
In the meantime for 45 minutes the

295
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,810
hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left

296
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,470
hemisphere. I do not understand numbers. I

297
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,330
do not understand a telephone but it's the

298
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,830
only plan I have so I take the phone pad

299
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,730
and I put it right here. I take the

300
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,730
business card and I put it right here and

301
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,610
I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on

302
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,550
the card to the shape of the squiggles on

303
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,770
the phone pad but then I would drift back

304
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,670
out into La La Land and not remember when

305
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,630
I come back if I had already dialed those

306
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,130
numbers.

307
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,470
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a

308
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,670
stump and cover the numbers as I went

309
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,290
along and pushed them so that as I would

310
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,550
come back to normal reality I'd be able to

311
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,830
tell,

312
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,850
yes I've already dialed that number.

313
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,350
Eventually the whole number gets dialed

314
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,810
and I'm listening to the phone and my

315
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,550
colleague picks up the phone and he says

316
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,930
to me,

317
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,350
woo woo woo.

318
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,690
myself,

319
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,190
oh my gosh, he sounds like a golden

320
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,830
retriever.

321
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,190
And so I say to him, clear in my mind, I

322
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,730
say to him, this is Jill, I need help. And

323
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,270
what comes out of my voice is,

324
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,690
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo,

325
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,170
they think oh my gosh, I sound like a

326
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,490
golden retriever. So I couldn't know, I

327
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,150
didn't know that I couldn't speak or

328
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,030
understand language until I tried.

329
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,810
So he recognizes that I need help and he

330
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,510
gets me help. And a little while later,

331
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,630
I'm writing in an ambulance from one

332
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,890
hospital across Boston to Mass General

333
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,450
Hospital.

334
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,670
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

335
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,730
And just like a balloon with the last bit

336
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,810
of air just right out of the balloon, I

337
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,610
just felt my energy lift and just I felt

338
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,170
my spirit surrender.

339
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,010
And at that moment, I knew that I was no

340
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,770
longer the choreographer of my life.

341
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,110
And either the doctors rescue my body and

342
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,270
give me a second chance at life, or this

343
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,890
was perhaps my moment of transition.

344
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,730
When I woke later that afternoon, I was

345
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,310
shocked to discover that I was still

346
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,710
alive.

347
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,290
When I felt my spirit surrender, I said

348
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,870
goodbye to my life. And my mind was now

349
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,190
suspended between two very opposite planes

350
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,350
of reality.

351
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,530
Stimulation coming in through my sensory

352
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,530
system felt like pure pain.

353
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,950
Light burned my brain like wildfire and

354
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,650
sounds were so loud and chaotic that I

355
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,890
could not pick a voice out from the

356
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,670
background noise. And I just wanted to

357
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,690
escape because I could not identify the

358
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,530
position of my body in space.

359
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,650
I felt enormous and expansive,

360
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,050
like a genie just liberated from her

361
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,550
bottle.

362
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,590
And my spirit soared free like a great

363
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,450
whale gliding through a sea of silent

364
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,210
euphoria,

365
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,830
nirvana.

366
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,230
I found nirvana.

367
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,910
And I remember thinking there's no way I

368
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,470
would ever be able to squeeze the

369
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,230
enormousness of myself back inside this

370
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,370
tiny little body.

371
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,910
But then I realized,

372
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,610
but I'm still alive.

373
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,270
I'm still alive. And I have found nirvana.

374
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,810
And if I have found nirvana and I'm still

375
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,650
alive, then everyone who is alive can find

376
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,330
nirvana.

377
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,690
And I pictured a world filled with

378
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,910
beautiful,

379
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,290
peaceful,

380
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,150
compassionate, loving people who knew that

381
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,550
they could come to this space at any time

382
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,530
and that they could purposely choose to

383
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,050
step to the right of their left

384
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,770
hemispheres and find this peace.

385
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,890
And then I realized what a tremendous gift

386
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,290
this experience could be. What a stroke of

387
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,330
insight this could be to how we live our

388
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,890
lives.

389
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,570
And it motivated me to recover.

390
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,250
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,

391
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,410
the surgeons went in and they removed a

392
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,270
blood clot the size of a golf ball that

393
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,210
was pushing on my language centers. Here I

394
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,270
am with my mama,

395
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,390
who's a true angel in my life.

396
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,090
It took me eight years to completely

397
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,550
recover.

398
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,790
So who are we?

399
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,890
We are the life force power of the

400
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,170
universe with manual dexterity and two

401
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,190
cognitive minds.

402
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,850
And we have the power to choose moment by

403
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,690
moment who and how we want to be in the

404
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,150
world.

405
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,980
I can step into the consciousness of my

406
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,840
right hemisphere,

407
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,500
where we are

408
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,440
I am the life force power of the universe.

409
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,040
I am the life force power of the 50

410
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,920
trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that

411
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,900
make up my form. And one, with all that

412
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,200
is,

413
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,220
or I can choose to step into the

414
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,000
consciousness of my left hemisphere where

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,440
I become a single individual,

416
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,340
a solid, separate from the flow,

417
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,960
separate from you.

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,520
I am Dr. Jill Baltic Taylor, intellectual,

419
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
neural anatomist.

420
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,880
These are the inside of me.

421
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,840
Which would you choose?

422
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,720
Which do you choose and when?

423
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,520
I believe that the more time we spend

424
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,880
choosing to run the deep inner peace

425
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,560
circuitry of our right hemispheres,

426
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,880
the more peace we will project into the

427
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,280
world

428
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,220
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

429
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,860
And I thought that was an idea worth

430
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,380
spreading.

431
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,450
You

432
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,350
You

433
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,830
You

434
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,030
You
