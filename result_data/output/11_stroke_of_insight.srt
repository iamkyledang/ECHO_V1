1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,980
So if you want to make six figures, you

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,720
can't just be talking about you want to

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,460
make six figures. You hear what I'm saying

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:20,860
to you tonight?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,180
If you do the three things I tell you to

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,200
do tonight, I guarantee you whatever it is

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,900
you want to do in life, you'll be able to

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,040
do.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,960
You will be able to accomplish whatever

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,360
you want to academically, financially,

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,720
relationally, whatever. So three things.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,980
All right, I'm going to tell you this

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,400
story. I got to get out of here. And the

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,760
story is about, you guys have probably

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,500
heard about this before. It was a young

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,080
man who, you know, he wanted to make a lot

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,980
of money and so he went to this guru,

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,400
right?

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,420
And he told the guru, you know, I want to

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,060
be on the same level you are. And so the

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,540
guru said, if you want to be on the same

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,240
level I'm on, I'll meet you tomorrow at

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,660
the beach at 4 AM.

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,380
He liked the beach.

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,860
I said, I want to make money. I don't want

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,220
to swim.

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Guru said, if you want to make money, I'll

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,140
meet you tomorrow at 4 AM.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,100
So the young man got there at 4 AM. He is all

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,780
raided rock and roll, got on the suit,

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,200
should have worn shorts.

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,040
The old man grabs his hands and said, how

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,580
bad do you want to be successful? He said,

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,160
real bad. He said, walk on out in the

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,440
water.

36
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,520
So he walks out into the water. Watch

37
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,240
this. When he walks out into the water, it

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,980
goes waist deep.

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,880
So he's like, this guy crazy.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
He's like, I want to make money. He got

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,760
me. I just swim.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I didn't ask to be a lifeguard.

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,780
I want to make money. He got me in. So he

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,360
said, come out a little further. Walked

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,600
out a little further. Then he had it right

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
around this area.

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,740
It's still the area.

48
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,480
So this old man crazy. He's making money,

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,160
but he is crazy.

50
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,340
He said, come on out a little further. He

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,960
came out a little further.

52
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
He was right at his mouth. My man like,

53
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,620
I'm about to go back in here. This guy is

54
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,940
mine.

55
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,000
So the old man said, I thought you said

56
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,820
you wanted to be successful. He said, I

57
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,500
do. He said, walk a little further. He

58
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,780
came, dropped his head in, held him down,

59
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,820
hold him down. My man getting scratched

60
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,620
and holding him down. I got you. I know

61
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,520
you brushed it out, but I got you. He had

62
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,240
him held down. I need you for

63
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,620
illustration.

64
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,660
He had him held down just before my man

65
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,760
was about to pass out. He raised him up.

66
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,160
He said, I got a question for you.

67
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,040
Somebody answered the question for me. He

68
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,880
said, when you were underwater, what did

69
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
you want to do?

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,340
Lee, I'm looking for a different word

71
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,400
though. What's that word?

72
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,740
He said, I wanted to breathe.

73
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,420
He told the guy,

74
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,880
he said, when you want to succeed,

75
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,600
as bad as you want to breathe, then you'll

76
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,140
be successful.

77
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,660
I don't know how many of y 'all got asthma

78
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,120
in here today, but if you ever had an

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,180
asthma attack before,

80
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,440
you sure to breath.

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,440
That's so big.

82
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,400
Shortness of breath. You're wheezing.

83
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,780
The only thing you're trying to do is get

84
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,300
some air.

85
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,820
You don't care about no basketball game.

86
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,400
You don't care what's on TV. You don't

87
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,980
care about nobody calling you. You don't

88
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,840
care about a party.

89
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,280
The only thing you care about when you're

90
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
trying to breathe is to get some fresh

91
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,800
air. That's it.

92
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,940
And when you get to the point where all

93
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,540
you want to do is be successful, as bad as

94
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,900
you want to breathe, then you'll be

95
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,400
successful.

96
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,840
And I'm here to tell you, number one, that

97
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,700
most of you say you want to be successful,

98
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,980
but you don't want it badly. You just kind

99
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,600
of want, it.

100
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,680
You don't want it worse than you want to

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,540
party. You don't want it as much as you

102
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,200
want to be cool.

103
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,720
Most of you don't want success as much as

104
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,320
you want to sleep.

105
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,760
Some of you love sleep more than you love

106
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,740
success. And I'm here to tell you today,

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,240
if you're going to be successful, you've

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,920
got to be willing to give up sleep.

109
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
You've got to be willing to live up to

110
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,880
three hours of sleep, two hours. If you

111
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,740
really want to be successful, someday

112
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,300
you'll have to stay up three days in a

113
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,480
row.

114
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,720
Because if you go to sleep, you might miss

115
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,060
the opportunity to be successful. That's

116
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,800
how bad you've got to want it. You've got

117
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,660
to go days without listening to me. You've

118
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,360
got to want to be successful so bad that

119
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
you forget to eat.

120
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,000
Beyoncé said, one, she was on the set

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,260
doing her thing. Three days had gone by.

122
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,560
She forgot she didn't eat.

123
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,700
Because she was engaged. I'll never forget

124
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,500
when 50 Cent was doing his movie. I did a

125
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,160
little research on 50. And 50 said that

126
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
when he wasn't doing the movie, he was

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,740
doing the soundtrack.

128
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,220
And they said, when do you sleep, 50?

129
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Sleep, he said sleep. Sleep is for those

130
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
people who are broke.

131
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,420
I don't sleep.

132
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,720
So I got an opportunity to make a dream

133
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
become a reality.

134
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,980
Football players. How many footballs

135
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,460
players?

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,340
Got anybody like football in here? Raise

137
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,300
your hand. Anybody like football?

138
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,520
Image Smith. I used to be a cowboy fan.

139
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,540
Before they did my boy Tom Landry wrong. I

140
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,780
used to be a cowboy fan. And watch this.

141
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,500
There was a commercial. Image Smith had

142
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,380
won his first soup bowl. And he had this

143
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,720
commercial. And he was lifting weights.

144
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,120
All of you saw the commercial. He was

145
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,260
lifting. And he said,

146
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,580
Image said, you know what? I won the soup

147
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,880
bowl. So I can rest now.

148
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,460
He was doing his bench press. So he said,

149
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,420
I won the soup bowl. So I can rest now. So

150
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,940
he throws up about 325.

151
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,600
Boom.

152
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,400
And he rests for about two seconds.

153
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,440
And he.

154
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,160
Boom.

155
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,960
Boom.

156
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,500
Boom. Boom. Boom. Did you see that?

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
He had already won a soup bowl. He said, I

158
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
think I'm going to take a rest. And he

159
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,160
rests for how long? One second. Most of

160
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
you won't be successful. Because when

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,420
you're studying and you get tired, you

162
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,780
quit.

163
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,600
And I'm here to tell you today, if you got

164
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,020
it, somebody came on off the other day

165
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,420
crying.

166
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,160
I said, look, don't cry to give up. Cry to

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,720
keep going.

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,080
Don't cry to quit.

169
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,560
You already in pain. You already hurt. Get

170
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,700
a reward from it.

171
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,680
Don't go to sleep until you succeed.

172
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,960
Listen to me. I'm here to tell you today

173
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,620
that you can come here. You can jump up.

174
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,500
You can do flips. You can be excited when

175
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,260
we give away money. But listen to me.

176
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,760
You'll never be successful until I don't

177
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,500
have to give you a dime to do what you do.

178
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,740
You won't be successful until you say, I

179
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,520
don't need that money.

180
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,420
Because I got it in here.

181
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,440
Listen to me. Emmett Smith said this at

182
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
the end of the commercial. Emmett Smith

183
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
said, all men are created equal. Some work

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,140
harder in three seasons.

185
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
I'm going to say it again because you

186
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,560
might have missed it. All men are created

187
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,260
equal.

188
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
Some work harder in three seasons.

189
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,480
So that means that there are some people

190
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,060
who are going to see the professor,

191
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,640
going to see the TA. And even when the

192
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,740
professor says, I don't meet with you. My

193
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,500
TA meets with you. You say, I don't want

194
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,360
to talk to your TA.

195
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,260
I don't pay the TA.

196
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,380
I pay you to teach me.

197
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,580
So you're going to have to find some time

198
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,460
to meet me. If I got to meet you at the

199
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,680
mall, if I got to meet you at your house,

200
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,380
you are going to see me.

201
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,540
Listen to me. All men are created equal.

202
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,460
Some work harder in three seasons. When I

203
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,100
went to college, guys were way smarter

204
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,000
than me. 4 .0's, 3 .0's, they went to the

205
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,220
Ivy League high schools, came to Oakwood

206
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
from these great high schools. Most of

207
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,240
them are not doing what I'm doing. Why?

208
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,620
Because it's not about where you come

209
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,160
from. It's about heart.

210
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,540
You come to a place where, you know, being

211
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,240
smart ain't enough.

212
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,520
You've got to have heart.

213
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,260
That's number one. Watch number two.

214
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,180
Number two. Catch number two. I wrote a

215
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,200
dime. I want to make sure you got it. It

216
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,760
says to be, watch this. Watch this. We're

217
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,900
talking about sacrifice now.

218
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,100
The important thing is this. You're right.

219
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,420
You know what I'm saying? Because I only

220
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,800
have about three more minutes. Listen to

221
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,780
me. The most important thing is this. To

222
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,940
be able at any moment to sacrifice what

223
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,620
you are for what you will become.

224
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,100
That's the number two thing. You've got to

225
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,740
catch that one.

226
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,000
To be able to listen to me at any moment.

227
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,320
Some of you, you can make sacrifices when

228
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,000
Monday Night Football is not on. You can

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,880
make a sacrifice. But when the game come

230
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,300
on, for some reason, you just attach to

231
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,520
it.

232
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,360
For some of you, when your favorite show

233
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
come on, you can make sacrifices on

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
Sunday. Well, they ain't going on.

235
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,060
But when your favorite show comes on

236
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,420
Monday Night Football, some of you, you

237
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,180
focus into the phone with it. And you got

238
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
to answer it. If I don't answer the phone,

239
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm going to die.

240
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm saying to you today that there are

241
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,980
some of you, if you give up your cell

242
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,500
phone, you would be successful.

243
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,980
But your cell phone is more important to

244
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
you than your success.

245
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm going to say it again, I'm going to

246
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,340
hurt somebody.

247
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,820
I'm going to hurt somebody.

248
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,460
Some of you need to give up your cell

249
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,760
phone because the time you spend on your

250
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,260
cell phone could be used for your success.

251
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,820
The time you could be using to be

252
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,460
successful,

253
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,700
you're using it on the cell. And the cell

254
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,420
phone is not bringing you anything but a

255
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,620
bill.

256
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,300
And somebody has told you, you couldn't

257
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,680
live without it. I'm talking about going

258
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
deep now, giving up stuff. Watch what it

259
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,000
says.

260
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,860
To be able at any moment to sacrifice what

261
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,660
we are for what we can be. I don't do well

262
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,780
than math. You're right.

263
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,240
You ain't never studied.

264
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm not good at writing because you have

265
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,440
never written before.

266
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,020
But I dare you to fail in writing for a

267
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,280
whole year to see if you can get to the

268
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,520
end.

269
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
I dare you to fail.

270
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,580
I dare you to take that same class over

271
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,640
and over again. I dare you to stop

272
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,780
dropping classes like you saw.

273
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,900
Always want to give up. I'm dropping. Why

274
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,460
are you dropping?

275
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,340
I'm so grateful that the slaves didn't

276
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,060
drop and quit. Say, I'm just going to

277
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,140
stop. I'm a slave. I'm just going to be a

278
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,320
slave.

279
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm going to quit. Listen to me. The

280
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,980
slaves said, we will live because one day

281
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,620
we will become.

282
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,660
We won't always be slaves.

283
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,900
So today, although we're slaves, we're

284
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,760
going to act like we free. And one day our

285
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,900
children will be free. If the slaves would

286
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,540
have just said, we quit, we give up. We

287
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,040
would have died in the middle passage.

288
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
But some slaves said, I don't care what we

289
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,260
go through. We're going to survive this.

290
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,040
400 years of slavery. We're going to get

291
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
through this. And you can't get through an

292
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,200
1825.

293
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,040
You can't get through a writing class. And

294
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,940
you got tutor after tutor, resource after

295
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,420
resource.

296
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,720
The problem is you ain't never felt no

297
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,020
pain before. You're soft.

298
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,260
It's a soft generation.

299
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
You quit on everything.

300
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,240
Our people did not quit.

301
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,780
Harry and Tubman not only made it. She

302
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,000
went back and got some more.

303
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,700
She said, you know what? I made it. But

304
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,260
I'm going to walk all the way. Listen to

305
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,340
me. Shh. Not ride the bus. I'm going to

306
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,600
walk all the way back now to the south to

307
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
get some more. And you quit on 1825.

308
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,180
Now watch this. You quit after you listen

309
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,860
to me. You get a sleeping bag and you wait

310
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,380
for them.

311
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,860
You wait for the first WRA instructor to

312
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,300
come in. And you come out you're sleeping

313
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,080
bag. I need help.

314
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,140
You quit after you do that.

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,220
You quit after you had. Listen to me. A

316
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,700
WRA party.

317
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,940
I'm having a party. Everybody come over. I

318
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,320
got food and everything. And let them get

319
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,060
over there. Let it be all the best riders.

320
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,140
All right. I'm food job. I want to have a

321
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,760
writing party.

322
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm serious.

323
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,700
You quit and you ain't even tried yet.

324
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,460
Last one. I'm sorry. Last one.

325
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
Listen to me. Pain is temporary.

326
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,060
It may last for a minute or an hour or a

327
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,440
day or even a year.

328
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,520
But eventually it will subside.

329
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,840
And something else will take its place.

330
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,040
If I quit, however,

331
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,380
it will last forever.

332
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,000
Listen to me. I'm telling you as I leave

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,200
you.

334
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm telling you as I leave you. I was

335
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
homeless for two and a half years.

336
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,560
And apart from most of you, you never felt

337
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,860
no pain before. Y 'all spoiled.

338
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
Y 'all spoiled. Some of y 'all spoiled.

339
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Just bottom line.

340
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,080
Your parents have done everything for you.

341
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,800
You never had to do nothing for yourself.

342
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,020
You spoiled. We don't keep it real

343
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,940
tonight. Some of you are spoiled brats.

344
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,340
Every time you ever got in trouble,

345
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,360
somebody in your house got you out of it.

346
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,260
Every time you've done something you're

347
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,920
not supposed to do. People say, your

348
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
mother's a tyrant. You're right. She

349
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
kicked me out. You're right. She's mean.

350
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,980
But she developed a man. Because she put

351
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,320
me out there and said, you're going to

352
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,000
have to grow up. And some of you have

353
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,100
never learned to grow up.

354
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,640
And so every time something gets hard, you

355
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,340
quit. You call mama. I dare you to take a

356
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,760
little pain.

357
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,920
I dare you.

358
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,220
I dare you not to go home.

359
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,640
Somebody said, I have to go home. I feel

360
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,060
bad. Go through it.

361
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,860
You ain't going to die at the end of pain

362
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,420
and success.

363
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,940
You're not going to die because you're

364
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,800
feeling a little pain.

365
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm not eating like I eat at home. That's

366
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,600
why you're about to go to the next level.

367
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,920
Because if you keep eating like you ate at

368
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,260
home, you'll keep being a boy or a girl.

369
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
It's time to become man woman.

370
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,120
So don't worry about a little pain.

371
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,700
My greatest asset is I was homeless.

372
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,620
So I can't feel a lot of pain.

373
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,380
I've already been alone.

374
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,940
There's not a lot of hurt I can

375
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,200
feel.

376
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,320
On a little paper.

377
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,540
On a little test. So I leave you. I leave

378
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,260
you. Listen to me.

379
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,140
We have gotten to a point where it's

380
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,660
midterms and we're moving forward.

381
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
The days of you getting money. I'm not

382
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,940
saying we're quitting. But I'm saying the day

383
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,600
has got to go from external to internal.

384
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,700
You have to give it everything you got. No

385
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,980
more TV. No more parties. No more plans.

386
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
If you have a 4 .0, what you need to be

387
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,800
doing is studying.

388
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,540
Get off the phone.

389
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm sorry. I'm not available until the end

390
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,980
of this year.

391
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,860
No, I'm for real. You reached the right

392
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,400
number but you called me at the wrong

393
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,780
time.

394
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,600
Call me back January 1st.

395
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm about to get busy now.

396
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,460
Huh?

397
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,020
I want you to have a countdown of your

398
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,420
own.

399
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,960
And say when the countdown is over, with a

400
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,940
real, shh, watch me. Because when I was

401
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,320
homeless, I knew something was wrong. I

402
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,800
knew that wasn't the best of me. One day I

403
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,540
said, will the real Eric Thomas please

404
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,200
stand up?

405
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,920
Will the real Eric Thomas please stand up?

406
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,800
Stop being this high school dropout. Stop

407
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
giving up. Stop sweeping on the street.

408
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,940
Stop walking up and down FICO Avenue like

409
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,100
you ain't got nothing. And get your GED.

410
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,120
Stop being afraid to take a test.

411
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,940
Stop being afraid to go to college because

412
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,720
your daddy didn't go, and your mama didn't

413
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,480
go. Stop being afraid and be the best Eric

414
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,220
Thomas you can be. But listen to me. It's

415
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,300
going to be hard. It took me 12 years to

416
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,260
get a four-year degree. But I got it. And

417
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,780
guess what? On a degree, they don't have

418
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,020
dates.

419
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,660
So if it took you four, it took me 12,

420
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,680
they don't show up nowhere.

421
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,460
But I'm exactly where I wanted to be.

422
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,480
Because I realized,

423
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,040
I got to commit my very being to this

424
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,800
thing. I got to breathe it. I got to feel

425
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,760
it. I got to sleep it. And until you get

426
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
there, you'll never be successful in life.

427
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
But once you get there, I guarantee you

428
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,100
the world is yours.

429
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,620
So work hard. And you can have whatever it

430
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,160
does you want? Thank you guys for your time.

431
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,100
Thank you.
