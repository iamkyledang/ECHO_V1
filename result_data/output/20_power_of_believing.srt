1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Today I want to tell you three stories

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,700
from my life. That's it. No big deal.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,300
Just three stories.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,760
The first story is about connecting the

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,100
dots.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,280
I dropped out of Reed College after the

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,340
first six months but then stayed around as

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,360
a drop -in for another 18 months or so

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,300
before I really quit.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,740
So why'd I drop out?

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,040
It started before I was born.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,380
My biological mother was a young unwed

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,660
graduate student and she decided to put me

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,300
up for adoption.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,500
She felt very strongly that I should be

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,880
adopted by college graduates so everything

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,360
was all set for me to be adopted at birth

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
by a lawyer and his wife.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,460
Except that when I popped out they decided

20
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,280
at the last minute that they really wanted

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,640
a girl.

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,180
So my parents who were on a waiting list

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,940
got a call in the middle of the night

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,580
asking,

25
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,220
we've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,580
want him?

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,200
They said,

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,120
of course.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,660
My biological mother found out later that

30
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,560
my mother had never graduated from college

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,760
and that my father had never graduated

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,420
from high school.

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,540
She refused to sign the final adoption

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,980
papers.

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,740
She only relented a few months later when

36
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,200
my parents promised that I would go to

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,500
college.

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,800
This was the start in my life.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
And 17 years later I did go to college but

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,280
I naively chose a college that was almost

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,500
as expensive as Stanford and all of my

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,340
working class parents' savings were being

43
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,640
spent on my college tuition.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,100
After six months I couldn't see the value

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,380
in it.

46
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,880
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,560
life and no idea how college was going to

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,380
help me figure it out.

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,240
And here I was spending all the money my

50
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,980
parents had saved their entire life.

51
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,480
So I decided to drop out and trust that it

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,740
would all work out okay.

53
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,600
It was pretty scary at the time but

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,380
looking back it was one of the best

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,400
decisions I ever made.

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,820
The minute I dropped out I could stop

57
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,840
taking the required classes that didn't

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,560
interest me and begin dropping in on the

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,460
ones that looked far more interesting.

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,040
It wasn't all romantic.

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,740
I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on

62
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,900
the floor in friends rooms.

63
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,740
I returned Coke bottles for the five cent

64
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,580
deposits to buy food with and I would walk

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,480
the seven miles across town every Sunday

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,380
night to get one good meal a week at the

67
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,240
Hard Krishna temple.

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,000
I loved it and much of what I stumbled

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,480
into by following my curiosity and

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,400
intuition turned out to be priceless later

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,720
on.

72
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,540
Let me give you one example.

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,620
Reed College at that time offered perhaps

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,560
the best calligraphy instruction in the

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,880
country.

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,420
Throughout the campus every poster every

77
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,100
label on every drawer was beautifully hand

78
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,940
Calligrapher.

79
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,540
Because I had dropped out and didn't have

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,620
to take the normal classes I decided to

81
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,180
take a calligraphy class to learn how to

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,600
do this.

83
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,340
I learned about serif and sans serif

84
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,780
typefaces about varying the amount of

85
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,880
space between different letter

86
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,160
combinations about what makes great

87
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,320
typography great.

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,740
It was beautiful historical artistically

89
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,020
subtle in a way that science can't capture

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,900
and I found it fascinating.

91
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,340
None of this had even a hope of any

92
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,400
practical application in my life.

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,040
But 10 years later when we were designing

94
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,560
the first Macintosh computer it all came

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,600
back to me and we designed it all into the

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,760
Mac.

97
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
It was the first computer with beautiful

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,700
typography.

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,700
If I had never dropped in on that single

100
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,000
course in college the Mac would have never

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,180
had multiple typefaces or proportionally

102
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,960
spaced fonts and since Windows just copied

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,080
the Mac it's likely that no personal

104
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,100
computer would have them.

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,640
If I had never dropped out I would have

106
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,460
never dropped in on that calligraphy class

107
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,580
and personal computers might not have the

108
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,180
wonderful typography that they do.

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,160
Of course, it was impossible to connect the

110
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,980
dots looking forward when I was in college

111
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,380
but it was very, very clear looking

112
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,900
backwards 10 years later.

113
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,080
Again you can't connect the dots looking

114
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,260
forward you can only connect them looking

115
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,820
backwards so you have to trust that the

116
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,740
dots will somehow connect in your future.

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
You have to trust in something your gut

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,620
destiny life karma whatever

119
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,920
because believing that the dots will

120
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,420
connect down the road will give you the

121
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,000
confidence to follow your heart even when

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,540
it leads you off the well-worn path and

123
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,820
that will make all the difference.

124
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,040
My second story is about love and loss.

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,800
I was lucky I found what I love to do

126
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,760
early in life.

127
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,140
Was and I started Apple in my parents

128
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,260
garage when I was 20.

129
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,500
We worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

130
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,040
grown from just the two of us in a garage

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,240
into a two billion dollar company with

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,420
over four thousand employees.

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,460
We just released our finest creation the

134
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,680
Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,000
30

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
and then I got fired.

137
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,840
How can you get fired from a company you

138
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,160
started?

139
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,740
Well as Apple grew we hired someone who I

140
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,660
thought was very talented to run the

141
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,680
company with me and for the first year or

142
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,800
so things went well but then our visions

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,820
of the future began to diverge and

144
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,120
eventually we had a falling out.

145
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,940
When we did our board of directors sided

146
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,720
with him and so at 30 I was out

147
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,540
and very publicly out.

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
What had been the focus of my entire adult

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,260
life was gone and it was devastating.

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,020
I really didn't know what to do for a few

151
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,260
months.

152
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,500
I felt that I had let the previous

153
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,060
generation of entrepreneurs down that I

154
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,560
had dropped the baton as it was being

155
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
passed to me.

156
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,080
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,060
tried to apologize for screwing up so

158
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,320
badly.

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I was a very public failure and I even

160
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,780
thought about running away from the valley

161
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,800
but something slowly began to dawn on me.

162
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,320
I still loved what I did.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,480
The turn of events at Apple had not

164
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,440
changed that one bit.

165
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,680
I'd been rejected but I was still in love

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,500
and so I decided to start over.

167
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,060
I didn't see it then but it turned out

168
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,680
that getting fired from Apple was the best

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,080
thing that could have ever happened to me.

170
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,180
The heaviness of being successful was

171
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,120
replaced by the lightness of being a

172
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,280
beginner again less sure about everything.

173
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,340
It freed me to enter one of the most

174
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,700
creative periods of my life.

175
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,120
During the next five years I started a

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,460
company named NEXT another company named

177
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,480
Pixar and fell in love with an amazing

178
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
woman who would become my wife.

179
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,380
Pixar went on to create the world's first

180
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,720
computer animated feature film Toy Story

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,080
and is now the most successful animation

182
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,460
studio in the world.

183
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,560
In a remarkable turn of events Apple

184
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,360
bought NEXT and I returned to Apple and

185
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
the technology we developed at NEXT is at

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
the heart of Apple's current renaissance

187
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,120
and Doreen and I have a wonderful family

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,460
together.

189
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm pretty sure none of this would have

190
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,140
happened if I hadn't been fired from

191
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,420
Apple.

192
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,300
It was awful tasting medicine but I guess

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,240
the patient needed it.

194
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,500
Sometimes life's going to

195
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
hit you in the head with a brick.

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,100
Don't lose faith.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm convinced that the only thing that

198
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,620
kept me going was that I loved what I did.

199
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
You've got to find what you love and that

200
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,780
is as true for work as it is for your

201
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,020
lovers.

202
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,820
Your work is going to fill a large part of

203
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,720
your life and the only way to be truly

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,940
satisfied is to do what you believe is

205
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,380
great work and the only way to do great

206
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,400
work is to love what you do.

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,220
If you haven't found it yet keep looking

208
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,720
and don't settle as with all matters of

209
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,420
the heart you'll know when you find it and

210
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,480
like any great relationship it just gets

211
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,300
better and better as the years roll on so

212
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,420
keep looking don't settle.

213
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,040
My third story is about death.

214
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,720
When I was 17 I read a quote that went

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,620
something like

216
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,240
if you live each day as if it was your

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,640
last someday you'll most certainly be

218
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:14,900
right.

219
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,020
It made an impression on me and since then

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,720
for the past 33 years I've looked in the

221
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,080
mirror every morning and asked myself if

222
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,600
today were the last day of my life what I

223
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,000
want to do what I am about to do today and

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
whenever the answer has been no for too

225
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,860
many days in a row

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,820
I know I need to change something

227
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,660
remembering that all be dead soon is the

228
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,460
most important tool I've ever encountered

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,440
to help me make the big choices in life

230
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,620
because almost everything

231
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,480
all external expectations all pride all

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,600
fear of embarrassment or failure these

233
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
things just fall away in the face of death

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
leaving only what is truly important

235
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,780
remembering that you are going to die is

236
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,180
the best way I know to avoid the trap of

237
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,900
thinking you have something to lose you

238
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,860
are already naked there is no reason not

239
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,560
to follow your heart no one wants to die

240
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,520
even people who want to go to heaven don't

241
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,120
want to die to get there and yet death is

242
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,540
the destination

243
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,650
share.

244
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,790
No one has ever escaped it.

245
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,130
And that is as it should be, because death

246
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,670
is very likely the single best invention

247
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,370
of life.

248
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,510
It's life's change agent. It clears out

249
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,850
the old to make way for the new.

250
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,730
Right now, the new is you.

251
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,930
But someday, not too long from now, you

252
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,950
will gradually become the old and be

253
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,450
cleared away.

254
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,930
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite

255
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,270
true.

256
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,850
Your time is limited,

257
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,850
so don't waste it living someone else's

258
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,150
life.

259
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,490
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living

260
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,110
with the results of other people's

261
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,330
thinking.

262
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,130
Don't let the noise of others' opinions

263
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,690
drown out your own inner voice.

264
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,390
And most important,

265
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,550
have the courage to follow your heart and

266
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,070
intuition.

267
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,310
They somehow already know what you truly

268
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,110
want to become.

269
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,850
Everything else is secondary.

270
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,650
Stay hungry.

271
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,090
Stay foolish.
