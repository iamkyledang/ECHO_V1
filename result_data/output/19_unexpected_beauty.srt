1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Today I want to tell you three stories

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,399
from my life. That's it. No big deal.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:04,919
Just three stories.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,240
The first story is about connecting the

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:11,240
dots.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,500
I dropped out of Reed College after the

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,639
first six months but then stayed around as

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,599
a drop -in for another 18 months or so

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,139
before I really quit.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,039
So why'd I drop out?

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:25,759
It started before I was born.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,059
My biological mother was a young unwed

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,879
graduate student and she decided to put me

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:33,879
up for adoption.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,979
She felt very strongly that I should be

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,579
adopted by college graduates so everything

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,159
was all set for me to be adopted at birth

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,439
by a lawyer and his wife.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,280
Except that when I popped out they decided

20
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:48,479
at the last minute that they really wanted

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:48,479
a girl.

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,579
So my parents who were on a waiting list

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:53,579
got a call in the middle of the night

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:55,839
asking,

25
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:57,740
we've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,159
want him?

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:01,420
They said,

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:01,420
of course.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,400
My biological mother found out later that

30
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,460
my mother had never graduated from college

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
and that my father had never graduated

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:11,400
from high school.

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,160
She refused to sign the final adoption

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,780
papers.

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,460
She only relented a few months later when

36
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,840
my parents promised that I would go to

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:20,840
college.

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:23,060
This was the start in my life.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
And 17 years later I did go to college but

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:29,880
I naively chose a college that was almost

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,960
as expensive as Stanford and all of my

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,060
working class parents' savings were being

43
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,140
spent on my college tuition.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,200
After six months I couldn't see the value

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:43,200
in it.

46
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,680
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,660
life and no idea how college was going to

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:48,660
help me figure it out.

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
And here I was spending all the money my

50
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:52,120
parents had saved their entire life.

51
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,160
So I decided to drop out and trust that it

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,560
would all work out okay.

53
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,060
It was pretty scary at the time but

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
looking back it was one of the best

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:04,600
decisions I ever made.

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
The minute I dropped out I could stop

57
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,400
taking the required classes that didn't

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,620
interest me and begin dropping in on the

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,260
ones that looked far more interesting.

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,760
It wasn't all romantic.

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,280
I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on

62
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,280
the floor in friends rooms.

63
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,860
I returned Coke bottles for the five cent

64
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,920
deposits to buy food with and I would walk

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,580
the seven miles across town every Sunday

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,900
night to get one good meal a week at the

67
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:32,900
Hard Krishna temple.

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,580
I loved it and much of what I stumbled

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,039
into by following my curiosity and

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,680
intuition turned out to be priceless later

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:41,680
on.

72
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:44,060
Let me give you one example.

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,819
Reed College at that time offered perhaps

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
the best calligraphy instruction in the

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:50,620
country.

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,980
Throughout the campus every poster every

77
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,680
label on every drawer was beautifully hand

78
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:56,680
Calligrapher.

79
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,240
Because I had dropped out and didn't have

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,240
to take the normal classes I decided to

81
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,719
take a calligraphy class to learn how to

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:04,719
do this.

83
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,620
I learned about serif and sans serif

84
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,580
typefaces about varying the amount of

85
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:11,580
space between different letter

86
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,920
combinations about what makes great

87
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:14,920
typography great.

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,539
It was beautiful historical artistically

89
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,640
subtle in a way that science can't capture

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:23,360
and I found it fascinating.

91
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,960
None of this had even a hope of any

92
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,140
practical application in my life.

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,340
But 10 years later when we were designing

94
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,260
the first Macintosh computer it all came

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,099
back to me and we designed it all into the

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,099
Mac.

97
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:39,099
It was the first computer with beautiful

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:41,960
typography.

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,580
If I had never dropped in on that single

100
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,539
course in college the Mac would have never

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,060
had multiple typefaces or proportionally

102
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:49,060
spaced fonts and since Windows just copied

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,599
the Mac it's likely that no personal

104
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,560
computer would have them.

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,159
If I had never dropped out I would have

106
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,780
never dropped in on that calligraphy class

107
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,480
and personal computers might not have the

108
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,700
wonderful typography that they do.

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,159
Of course, it was impossible to connect the

110
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,580
dots looking forward when I was in college

111
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:10,520
but it was very, very clear looking

112
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,319
backwards 10 years later.

113
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Again you can't connect the dots looking

114
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,560
forward you can only connect them looking

115
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,179
backwards so you have to trust that the

116
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,179
dots will somehow connect in your future.

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,679
You have to trust in something your gut

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,139
destiny life karma whatever

119
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,539
because believing that the dots will

120
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,459
connect down the road will give you the

121
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,459
confidence to follow your heart even when

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
it leads you off the well-worn path and

123
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,579
that will make all the difference.

124
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,779
My second story is about love and loss.

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,839
I was lucky I found what I love to do

126
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,419
early in life.

127
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,859
Was and I started Apple in my parents

128
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,839
garage when I was 20.

129
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,739
We worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

130
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:58,739
grown from just the two of us in a garage

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,819
into a two billion dollar company with

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,919
over four thousand employees.

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,899
We just released our finest creation the

134
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,339
Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,339
30

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,439
and then I got fired.

137
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,259
How can you get fired from a company you

138
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:15,259
started?

139
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,459
Well as Apple grew we hired someone who I

140
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,079
thought was very talented to run the

141
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:22,079
company with me and for the first year or

142
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,620
so things went well but then our visions

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,819
of the future began to diverge and

144
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,519
eventually we had a falling out.

145
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,620
When we did our board of directors sided

146
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,039
with him and so at 30 I was out

147
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:35,959
and very publicly out.

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,759
What had been the focus of my entire adult

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,259
life was gone and it was devastating.

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,500
I really didn't know what to do for a few

151
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:43,500
months.

152
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:45,239
I felt that I had let the previous

153
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,759
generation of entrepreneurs down that I

154
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,339
had dropped the baton as it was being

155
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,339
passed to me.

156
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,099
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,779
tried to apologize for screwing up so

158
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,199
badly.

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,500
I was a very public failure and I even

160
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:00,500
thought about running away from the valley

161
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:00,500
but something slowly began to dawn on me.

162
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:06,679
I still loved what I did.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,899
The turn of events at Apple had not

164
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:10,899
changed that one bit.

165
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,000
I'd been rejected but I was still in love

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:15,000
and so I decided to start over.

167
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,379
I didn't see it then but it turned out

168
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,459
that getting fired from Apple was the best

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,459
thing that could have ever happened to me.

170
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,479
The heaviness of being successful was

171
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,719
replaced by the lightness of being a

172
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,319
beginner again less sure about everything.

173
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,139
It freed me to enter one of the most

174
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:33,139
creative periods of my life.

175
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,699
During the next five years I started a

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:36,699
company named NEXT another company named

177
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,799
Pixar and fell in love with an amazing

178
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,399
woman who would become my wife.

179
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:43,399
Pixar went on to create the world's first

180
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,139
computer animated feature film Toy Story

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,919
and is now the most successful animation

182
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,539
studio in the world.

183
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,079
In a remarkable turn of events Apple

184
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,779
bought NEXT and I returned to Apple and

185
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,339
the technology we developed at NEXT is at

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,299
the heart of Apple's current renaissance

187
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,500
and Doreen and I have a wonderful family

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:04,500
together.

189
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,739
I'm pretty sure none of this would have

190
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,000
happened if I hadn't been fired from

191
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:11,000
Apple.

192
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,259
It was awful tasting medicine but I guess

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,579
the patient needed it.

194
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,839
Sometimes life's going to

195
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:18,839
hit you in the head with a brick.

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:20,659
Don't lose faith.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,859
I'm convinced that the only thing that

198
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,259
kept me going was that I loved what I did.

199
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,679
You've got to find what you love and that

200
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:29,679
is as true for work as it is for your

201
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:29,679
lovers.

202
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,839
Your work is going to fill a large part of

203
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,500
your life and the only way to be truly

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:35,500
satisfied is to do what you believe is

205
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,779
great work and the only way to do great

206
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,859
work is to love what you do.

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,419
If you haven't found it yet keep looking

208
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,339
and don't settle as with all matters of

209
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,439
the heart you'll know when you find it and

210
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,739
like any great relationship it just gets

211
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,359
better and better as the years roll on so

212
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,099
keep looking don't settle.

213
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,699
My third story is about death.

214
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,899
When I was 17 I read a quote that went

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:08,979
something like

216
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,039
if you live each day as if it was your

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,579
last someday you'll most certainly be

218
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:12,579
right.

219
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,579
It made an impression on me and since then

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,079
for the past 33 years I've looked in the

221
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,519
mirror every morning and asked myself if

222
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,579
today were the last day of my life what I

223
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,539
want to do what I am about to do today and

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,299
whenever the answer has been no for too

225
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:30,299
many days in a row

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,199
I know I need to change something

227
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,120
remembering that all be dead soon is the

228
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,299
most important tool I've ever encountered

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,319
to help me make the big choices in life

230
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,500
because almost everything

231
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,539
all external expectations all pride all

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,639
fear of embarrassment or failure these

233
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,439
things just fall away in the face of death

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,340
leaving only what is truly important

235
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,240
remembering that you are going to die is

236
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,379
the best way I know to avoid the trap of

237
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,740
thinking you have something to lose you

238
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,699
are already naked there is no reason not

239
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,399
to follow your heart no one wants to die

240
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,399
even people who want to go to heaven don't

241
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,779
want to die to get there and yet death is

242
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:17,779
the destination

243
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:17,779
share.

244
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,720
No one has ever escaped it.

245
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,259
And that is as it should be, because death

246
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:24,259
is very likely the single best invention

247
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,819
of life.

248
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,059
It's life's change agent. It clears out

249
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:31,059
the old to make way for the new.

250
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:33,340
Right now, the new is you.

251
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,879
But someday, not too long from now, you

252
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,059
will gradually become the old and be

253
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:40,059
cleared away.

254
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,399
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite

255
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:44,399
true.

256
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,439
Your time is limited,

257
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:47,439
so don't waste it living someone else's

258
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:47,439
life.

259
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,679
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living

260
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,159
with the results of other people's

261
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,019
thinking.

262
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,779
Don't let the noise of others' opinions

263
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,699
drown out your own inner voice.

264
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,620
And most important,

265
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,919
have the courage to follow your heart and

266
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:03,919
intuition.

267
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,120
They somehow already know what you truly

268
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:07,120
want to become.

269
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,079
Everything else is secondary.

270
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,159
Stay hungry.

271
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:14,159
Stay foolish.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome, everyone. It's my pleasure to

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,020
welcome all of you to Professor David

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,760
Patterson's talk.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,280
David Patterson probably needs no

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,780
introduction.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,340
He's been a professor of computer science

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,940
at University of California Berkeley for

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,020
40 years now.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,740
And he's made a lot of pioneering

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,700
contributions in computer systems, a lot

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,240
of which are technologies we use at Google

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,460
and elsewhere. So risk,

13
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,360
reduced instructions at computers,

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,200
RAID network of workstations and a lot

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,380
more.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,640
He has a pretty long bio here.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,980
I didn't realize he has won 35 awards, and

18
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,580
all of them are pretty prestigious.

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,080
National Academy of Engineering, National

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,680
Academy of Sciences, Silicon Valley

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,820
Engineering, all fame,

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,700
IEEE 1 -9 in medal.

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,540
And I'm sure I'm offending some

24
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,380
significant award by not saying that, but

25
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,980
he's had a very distinguished career.

26
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,780
And this talk today, in his own words,

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
collects advice that I wish had been given

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,940
when I started my career. And given how

29
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,840
distinguished that's been, I think it's

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,040
the talk we are all going to benefit from.

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,020
So welcome. Well,

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,800
this is what happened is I decided,

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,560
somebody wrote me these slides about how

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,740
to have a bad career been out there for a

35
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,500
long time. And they asked me if there was

36
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
a video of it, and I couldn't find one. I

37
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,880
actually figured out that I gave this talk

38
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,560
first 20 years ago, but I've given it over

39
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,040
the years. So I decided to record it at

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,280
Berkeley,

41
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,160
and it ended up, and I announced that my

42
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,060
plan is to retire two days before this. So

43
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,940
it got a lot of visibility, and it's fun

44
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,540
to come here.

45
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,060
As far as I can tell, all of my former

46
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,160
students are going to end up here

47
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,500
sometime.

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,900
I also have to ask them if they're leaving

49
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,300
where they are. I know where they're

50
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,660
ending up, and it feels like it's open

51
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,220
home week here.

52
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,760
As I said, this is the advice I wish I

53
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,580
would have had in my career.

54
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,840
This got started about 30 years ago.

55
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,120
I decided I wanted to give advice on talk,

56
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,060
so I wrote how to give a bad talk.

57
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,160
And that was a lot of fun, and about 10

58
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,520
years later, how to have a bad career.

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,020
And about a couple of years ago, I did how

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,340
to have a bad research center. So this is

61
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,180
my bad series.

62
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:11,980
Now,

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm just going to put the

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
if you're interested,

65
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
these slides are certainly available as

66
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,860
well as the talk. And there's a lot of

67
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,380
papers and things that you can cite if you

68
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,220
want to read more about it. And I'd like

69
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,960
to thank a bunch of people for making

70
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,020
suggestions that I've incorporated or

71
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,680
their careers inspired them. One of those

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,380
two.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
So the parts, there are two parts to the

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,060
talk. The kind of tongue -in -cheek, how

75
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,680
to have a bad career, and then how to

76
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,140
avoid a bad career. And then I'll open up

77
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,260
for questions and answers.

78
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,160
And then I'll wrap things up whenever we

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
have to wrap things up and take the last

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,860
five or ten minutes talking about my

81
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,360
story,

82
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,720
how I got here, and what works for me. So

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,000
you want to be a leader of the field,

84
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,320
especially if you're an academia.

85
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,260
So how can you do that? Well, invent a new

86
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,880
field is a perfect way to do that.

87
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
And you want to be the only person on that

88
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,820
field, so how can you invent a field and

89
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,580
be the only person?

90
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,180
Well, one way is, you know, different from

91
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,680
other fields, you want to be the lone

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,180
ranger. And the way you can be the lone

93
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,020
ranger, the only one that is there, is

94
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,540
your personality can help.

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,660
If you adopt the prima donna personality,

96
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,460
and some people don't know who a prima

97
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,040
Donna is, but if you adopt that

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,060
personality, nobody will want to work with

99
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
you, and you can drive people away and

100
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,240
then you'll be the world's leading expert

101
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,700
because you're the only one in that field.

102
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
In terms of the research horizons for your

103
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
new field, you might have a lot of

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
flexibility on success.

105
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
You know, you don't want to get too fine.

106
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,540
And if you say it's 20 years out, then,

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,540
you know, you've got 19 safe years, right?

108
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,160
And nobody's going to accuse you of doing

109
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,240
engineering work if it's 20 years out.

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,660
And, you know, stick to that topic for

111
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,960
your whole career. Now, if I'd only

112
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,260
followed that advice, my dissertation was

113
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,360
on microprogramming.

114
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,580
If I'd stuck to this, I would absolutely

115
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,800
be the world's expert in micro

116
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
-programming, partly because no one's

117
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,260
built a computer with microcode in 25

118
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,640
years.

119
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,620
And you kind of think of it like, it's

120
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,420
like fashion, you know, like skinny jeans

121
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,460
are popular now, or they were popular 25

122
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,940
years ago. If you just kept them, you

123
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,660
could reuse your own jeans. So, research

124
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,780
is like that. Wait,

125
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,060
I'll come back to you.

126
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay,

127
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
let complexity be your guide.

128
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,640
Confuse my enemies.

129
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
The best thing you can say is so

130
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,640
complicated, I can't understand what

131
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,560
you're talking about. Now, that's, you've

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,080
done a good job.

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,620
One reason is it's easy to claim credit

134
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,020
for things. If somebody else has done some

135
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,680
work, you can say, well, that was in my

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
paper, and since they don't understand it,

137
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,680
how can they contradict you, right?

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
The other thing that's surprising is it's

139
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,940
really a lot easier to be complicated. You

140
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,400
read the first end papers, and then it's,

141
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
you figure out the next one, and people

142
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,940
publish it. It's really much harder to be

143
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,180
simpler than it'd be complicated, so

144
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,320
that's the easy way to do it.

145
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,060
And this sentence captures it, right? If

146
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,920
it's UN -simple, how could you send your

147
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,020
colleagues to departments around the

148
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,600
world, be possibly appreciative, and so on

149
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
and so on. There you go. That's the way to

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,820
speak and to talk.

151
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,540
Never be proven wrong. The first thing you

152
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,360
want to do is don't implement anything.

153
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,360
It's hard to prove you wrong if you don't

154
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,820
implement it. Now, if some other control

155
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,560
colleague builds something, then whatever

156
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,980
you do, don't run any quantitative

157
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,660
experiments.

158
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,720
If they're not quantitative, then you

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,620
can't be proven wrong.

160
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,160
You've got the intuition.

161
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,140
You can just kind of extrapolate with

162
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,720
results that are put that in without any

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,100
experiment.

164
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,060
And, you know, your job isn't to help the

165
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,680
critics. You know, that's their job to

166
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,080
figure out.

167
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,280
Don't help them out. Now,

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
another reason is that clearly the success

169
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,340
of the career is to publish as much as you

170
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,860
can, and it takes time to build and to

171
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,280
measure. So if you don't do that, you can

172
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,440
get more results and have a more

173
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,100
successful career.

174
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,200
If somebody does it, the last thing you

175
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,880
want to do is run any benchmarks because

176
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,300
then they can compare your results to

177
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,880
other things.

178
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,780
The advice of being that you've got those

179
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,880
safe years, and the benchmarks can just,

180
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,940
the way you get out of that is to say,

181
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,100
well, this computer is for future

182
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
programs, not for current programs, and

183
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,480
then these benchmarks are too antiquated

184
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,320
to run on my computer.

185
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,560
Now, the other thing that we do in

186
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,340
computer science is we eject all the past.

187
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,580
You know, we're a new field for both

188
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,820
science and engineering, so we're not

189
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,420
hidebound by old-fashioned things like

190
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,240
the scientific method. We have the

191
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,740
computer scientific method. Instead of a

192
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,260
hypothesis,

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,060
we have a hunch.

194
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,500
A sequence of experiments, we know that

195
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,780
sequential is slow, so what we do,

196
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,020
we change one experiment all the

197
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,640
parameters at once. That's much faster

198
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,340
than the sequential approach. Parallelism

199
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,880
is a good idea.

200
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,180
And rather than prove or disprove a

201
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,080
hypothesis,

202
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,880
we discard if it doesn't support the

203
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,580
hunch, you know?

204
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,980
There's lots of data, it's a big data,

205
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
throw away the data, there's still plenty

206
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,120
of data left.

207
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,660
And document for others to reproduce,

208
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,100
we've already done it. We'll have more

209
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,840
results in the field if we don't waste our

210
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,360
time trying to reproduce each other's

211
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,680
results. That's the computer scientific

212
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,140
method.

213
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,940
Don't be distracted by others, avoid

214
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,500
feedback.

215
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,740
You know, a big part of that is

216
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,460
conversation,

217
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,360
and if you don't say anything, people

218
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
might think you're not very smart, so the

219
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,340
corollary of that is loud as smart, okay?

220
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,480
So be loud in conversations, even when you

221
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,540
don't know what you're talking about.

222
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,600
People will think you know what you're

223
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,160
talking about.

224
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,880
If you're the words -eluding expert, you

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,940
don't really need to read other things,

226
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,640
because you're the expert, right?

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,440
And you don't have to be interacted with

228
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,800
others, because they're not as good as you

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,020
are.

230
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,840
In terms of doing reviews for paper, if

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,900
it's simple and obvious,

232
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,200
it'd be insult the prior authors if you

233
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,620
accepted something simple and obvious,

234
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
they probably thought of it so you should

235
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,240
reject it.

236
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
If they're quantitative results, and I've

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,080
gotten this review before, well I already

238
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,140
knew that, so there's no surprise to

239
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,680
reject it, and just, you know, everything

240
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,140
else you might as well just reject.

241
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
You know, they're kind of competitors to

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,180
you in some way, and if they don't get

243
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,100
published, then you win, so that's a good

244
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,360
guideline.

245
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,680
Now, publishing journals is technology

246
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
transfer. You're the leading person in the

247
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,640
world, you're the expert, all you have to

248
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,400
do is write in the journal. It's not your

249
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,300
job to make it understandable to others

250
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,580
and to ordinary engineers.

251
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,220
Going to conferences, just waste some of

252
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,780
your valuable time that you could be

253
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,940
coming up with new ideas,

254
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,420
and, you know, having to interact with

255
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,600
industry and things like that, that's the

256
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
time waste, you write the journals,

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,240
you're done.

258
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,900
Now, clearly the winner is the one with

259
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,440
the most papers at the end of the career,

260
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,440
so I've come up with this pyramid of

261
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,560
success for publication that follows the

262
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,220
rule of four.

263
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,480
And the guideline is the CPU, least

264
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,140
publishing unit, the CPU is good for you.

265
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
So you start off with one idea, then with

266
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,680
rule of four, you get four journal papers

267
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,260
out of that,

268
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,820
with the miracle of world processing, then

269
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,500
you can get 16 extended abstracts and 64

270
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
technical reports from what's a single

271
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,080
idea. That's 84 publications,

272
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I guess that. And then in terms of getting

273
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,820
credit for it, my advice is to change your

274
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
name to the Swedish spelling of Anderson.

275
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,920
And then there's awkward time, oh, how are

276
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
we're going to put the office on the table?

277
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,160
You will say, well, I've always done it

278
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,800
alphabetically.

279
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,200
All my papers there. All right.

280
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,420
Writing commandments for a bad career.

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Valschelt not defined terms, that's what

282
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,500
dictionaries are before, and explaining

283
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,480
things, that'll just insult the reader, so

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,540
you want to be a little bit more

285
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,420
mysterious than that.

286
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,220
Valschelt use,

287
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,260
replace I will build with I have been

288
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,560
built.

289
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,880
You know, probably by the time your paper

290
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
gets published in a journal, somebody will

291
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,720
have implemented it, so it's okay to kind

292
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,080
of do that.

293
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,960
Valschelt not mentioned drawbacks to your

294
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,340
report,

295
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,280
that's not your job, that's the job of the

296
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,760
critics to figure out drawbacks.

297
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,520
You know, if you hide that, they'll never

298
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,000
notice it.

299
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,620
Valschelt not reference any papers, again,

300
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,020
except for maybe your own, or your

301
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,820
institution, and if the papers were any

302
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,080
good, they'd be people at your

303
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
institution, so don't do that.

304
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,360
And then you should publish before

305
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
implementing, because that's when your

306
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,640
system is the fastest.

307
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,720
Okay,

308
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,040
talk commandments for a bad career, this

309
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,280
is my bad career talk.

310
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,180
Valschelt not be neat,

311
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
you know, why take the time to spend it on

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,420
your slides to fix spelling errors,

313
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,460
grammatical errors, you could spend that

314
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,160
time on research.

315
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,220
Valschelt not waste space, you know, you

316
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,960
use up a lot of slides, that's a lot of

317
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,820
kilobytes being wasted there, you can save

318
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,600
like 100 kilobytes a year, which saves

319
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,040
some money.

320
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,560
Valschelt not covet brevity, do you really

321
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
want to sustain

322
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,340
the stereotype that engineers can't write,

323
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,380
right? You want to show full paragraphs,

324
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,200
beautiful English, and read it aloud.

325
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Valschelt cover the naked slides, I'll

326
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,820
show you what I mean by that later, but

327
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,320
you don't want to expose the whole slide

328
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,060
to everybody and shock them.

329
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,700
Valschelt not print large,

330
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,560
the important people sit in the front,

331
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:23,900
right?

332
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,880
So, who cares about the guys in the back?

333
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,300
Valschelt not use color,

334
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,940
use of color indicates,

335
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,520
you know, unfearful research, you're

336
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,380
emphasizing some words over others and

337
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,860
it's just to show a used color.

338
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,060
Valschelt not illustrate, Confucius says,

339
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,680
pictures worth 10, 000 words, who cares

340
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,260
about the wisdom of the ages, right?

341
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,960
And Valschelt not make eye contact, you

342
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,780
want to be humble, kind of pretend to be

343
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,560
humble, keep your eyes down, and you know,

344
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
try not to let anybody see you.

345
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,640
Valschelt not skip slides long talk, I

346
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,380
guarantee in this room somebody has done,

347
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,460
looked up, looked at their watch, see how

348
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,160
many slides they have, and their solution

349
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,280
is, I'll just talk faster, right? That's

350
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,960
what people do, you prepare the slides,

351
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
they want to see them all, and if you have

352
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,060
to, just cut off the conclusions, the last

353
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,540
couple of slides if you're out of time.

354
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,260
And then this is the golden rule, this one

355
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,020
can save you,

356
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,440
even if you violate the others, Valschelt

357
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,580
not practice. How can you be spontaneous

358
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,320
if you practice?

359
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,300
It'll feel practiced if you practice. So

360
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,980
don't do that, that's the last thing you

361
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,200
should do.

362
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
So here's an example of doing it, it

363
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,660
actually says PowerPoint, but it's using

364
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,580
Google Slides,

365
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,880
so try on these commandments.

366
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,080
So, put small.

367
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,980
Now these features, somebody, some

368
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,520
engineer at Google put these features in,

369
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,140
so you have to use them to be a good

370
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,840
Google employee.

371
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,360
So you want to hide your naked slides

372
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,460
there, that's some variety,

373
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
but again, no use of color.

374
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
There you go, that's another dramatic

375
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,140
entrance.

376
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,020
And then this last, the next one is just

377
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,340
my favorite, I'm glad somebody put the

378
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,920
time in to put this in, because it's very

379
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,320
useful.

380
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,920
There you go.

381
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,980
Okay, so that was the bad career advice,

382
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,460
let's talk about Alternatives Career.

383
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,220
This is taken from my career,

384
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,520
which spanned 40 years, so it's kind of an

385
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,340
academic, I hope it'll apply to you here.

386
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,720
It's in systems, not in theory.

387
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,220
And I'll go through these pieces one by

388
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,440
one. So advice to writing bad papers,

389
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,560
and I put some writing tips there, the

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,780
writing tips actually have some

391
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,460
grammatical errors in them following my

392
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,040
bad tradition, but you can go take a look.

393
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,920
So do the opposite of the bad paper

394
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,320
commandments.

395
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Do define your terms, distinguish will do

396
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
from have done. If you're writing for

397
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
critical review, reviewers are very

398
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,980
skeptical people, they're going to assume

399
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,500
the worst.

400
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,920
They are much more impressed if you point

401
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,380
out the drawbacks rather than they have to

402
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,940
discover them.

403
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,640
And you have to measure performance and

404
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,060
reference the work to be a scholar.

405
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,940
And the good news is, you guys build a

406
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,080
wonderful service to make that much easier

407
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,420
to do these days and help the scholar.

408
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,920
The best piece of advice I ever got was to

409
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,600
read Struck and White.

410
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,780
Struck believed in brevity so much, he

411
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,420
cherished brevity so much, he couldn't

412
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,260
write a long book.

413
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,360
The book itself is maybe 80 pages or so,

414
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,220
and it's chock-full of good advice.

415
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,380
Then we do this, the advice is basically

416
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,440
you go kind of top down.

417
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,080
You write a one-page outline with a

418
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,800
tentative title

419
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,420
with budgets, how much you need to write,

420
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,340
a lot of writing, that saves a lot of

421
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,060
writing if you don't have to do it.

422
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,940
Then a paragraph map, which is a topic

423
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,420
sentence,

424
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,960
as it goes the way through,

425
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,840
and it includes figures and captions. Even

426
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,240
today in 2016, it takes forever on a

427
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,980
computer to draw a figure.

428
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,680
And since you might throw that, you'll

429
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,800
probably throw that figure right here,

430
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,860
change it. The best technology to do that

431
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,380
today is gone to a whiteboard, you can have

432
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,220
colored pens, take a little cell phone

433
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,680
picture and stick that in your document,

434
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,580
that'll take you one tenth of the time as

435
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,880
trying to do something on a computer,

436
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,880
because you might throw it away.

437
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,960
And then we write the draft.

438
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,300
I like the Scientific American style,

439
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,160
which has really long captions, not

440
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,940
everybody does that, but you can move text

441
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,680
in there and associate with the figure. I

442
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,160
think that works well. I really like

443
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,020
tables a lot, there's a lot of dreary

444
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,720
facts, I love putting them into tables,

445
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,620
that works well for me.

446
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,760
Then in terms of when you're starting to

447
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,040
polish the text, read aloud. Your ear is

448
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,060
better than your eyes. When I start

449
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,860
reading a document, and I forget and I

450
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,400
stop saying it out loud, I lose track, but

451
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,720
if you hear the word, you can hear

452
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,640
terrible sentences and grammatical errors,

453
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,680
if you hear it.

454
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,380
There's technology.

455
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,460
In fact, I just learned about this thing.

456
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,960
It was from an English professor who

457
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,700
taught a massive open -op line course at

458
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,960
Berkeley. He said, why aren't you using a

459
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,240
grammar checker? And she said, this is the

460
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,340
world's best one, Pearson writer.

461
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,080
And it costs you a whole $20 a year and

462
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,140
it'll prevent terrible grammatical errors

463
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,240
and it'll even help style. In fact, I was

464
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,460
thinking,

465
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,920
you guys should buy this.

466
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,440
It's one of the things you're missing from

467
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,740
Google Documents. And this is the world's

468
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,280
best one.

469
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,680
I'm impressed that they can pull this off.

470
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
And then you get feedbacks and friends. Of

471
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,120
course, to get feedbacks and friends, if

472
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,700
you're writing to a deadline, you actually

473
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,220
have to get it done early,

474
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,340
which seems to be science fiction for

475
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,440
graduate students at least.

476
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,000
But you get it done early, then it gives

477
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,620
you time to give your friends feedback.

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,600
You can iterate.

479
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,000
And if you don't do that, if you're

480
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,700
writing something for review, then who's

481
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,120
your reviewer? It's the program committee.

482
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,020
What I've seen sitting on program

483
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,780
committees is a lot of the times the paper

484
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,480
gets rejected, not because you didn't do

485
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,220
something, it's because the program

486
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,880
committee didn't understand what you did.

487
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,380
And if you interact with outsiders, you've

488
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,680
got this chance of clearing that up.

489
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
As opposed to if you just look at it

490
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,540
yourself.

491
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Okay.

492
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,820
Not to write bad papers, bad talks,

493
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
basically do the opposite of bad

494
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,720
commandments.

495
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,840
There's two parts, preparation and

496
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,160
practice.

497
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,780
Most people take about two minutes of

498
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,600
slide. For some reason, I take one minute

499
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,760
of slide, and I don't know why.

500
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,580
You should plan on that a minute or minute

501
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,060
and a half, so you have plenty of time and

502
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,460
leave time for questions, since that's

503
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,440
some of the most important parts.

504
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,080
Despite Google engineers putting in

505
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,240
spinning text, you know, don't do that.

506
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,880
And then, you know, it's not a speech,

507
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,420
it's the first time you do it. It's a

508
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,540
talk, so you don't have to memorize it,

509
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,360
but have notes ready.

510
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,720
Practice is the key.

511
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
You want to do dry runs with friends to

512
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,820
get feedback. If you're giving a

513
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,680
professional talk,

514
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,880
the way you make impression is not only to

515
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,860
give a talk, but how you answer the

516
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,760
questions. I think for those of us in the

517
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,080
field a while, when you see somebody give

518
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,880
a dynamic talk and they really nail the

519
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,220
questions, you pay attention to that.

520
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,480
And then, so your practice ought to have

521
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,700
really tough questions, so you can

522
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,660
practice tough questions.

523
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,300
And then, with modern cell phones,

524
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
you can record yourself.

525
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,420
Not only your audio, you can watch

526
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,860
yourself. It's, you know, I have to tell

527
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,680
you, it's going to be a humbling experience.

528
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,120
You'll hear the crutches that you have in

529
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,780
your verbal speech. I start a lot of

530
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,920
sentences with so, I say, you'll be

531
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,080
shocked how bad it is, but everybody does

532
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
it, and this is the way you get better.

533
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,220
And I practice everything. I think of it,

534
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,820
I practice my talks just to show the

535
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,700
students who you're supposed to practice

536
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
your talks. But I practice my award

537
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,440
acceptance speeches, and they tear them

538
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,660
apart.

539
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
I would think an acceptance speech is

540
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,500
pretty good, but nope, nope, they make

541
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,220
them better. So,

542
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,200
practice.

543
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,320
Okay, now,

544
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,440
the other thing that I was going to do in

545
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,080
this talk is quoted Richard Hamming.

546
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,840
Richard Hamming actually came to Berkeley

547
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,480
when I was young and a professor, a larval

548
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,280
professor, and he gave this talk, You and

549
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,780
Your Research,

550
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,960
which is more or less how to do great

551
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,720
research like me.

552
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,720
And so, Richard Hamming of Hamming Code,

553
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,000
you know, Hamming Distance,

554
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,960
the reason memories don't make mistakes,

555
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,260
spent his career mostly at Bell Labs, and

556
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,800
it's pretty clear from watching these

557
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,560
videos, he's a very opinionated guy.

558
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,720
He doesn't, he's not saying, well, maybe

559
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,260
you should do this. But he watched careers

560
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,540
over Bell Labs, he saw people fail, he saw

561
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,280
people succeed,

562
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,420
and I'll quote him surely one minute

563
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,240
seconds every time.

564
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,220
So, this is him talking about the

565
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,680
importance of communication, and you'll

566
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,980
get his personality from this one.

567
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,580
Which brings me to the topic of

568
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,000
communication.

569
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,360
You need to learn to communicate orally in

570
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,220
talks like this,

571
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,880
written and written reports, and casual

572
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,480
conversations.

573
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,600
In the middle of a conference, you have to

574
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,140
be able to get up and say, that's wrong

575
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,980
for these reasons, bing, bing, bing, bing,

576
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,860
and you win.

577
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,000
If you sit around and say, well, I'll

578
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,220
write a report tomorrow after I've thought

579
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,840
about it some more,

580
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,680
the decision is made, we go ahead and it

581
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,640
doesn't matter what you do then.

582
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,700
The ability to communicate at three

583
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
levels. How do you learn it?

584
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,600
You can read books if you want to, but

585
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,040
forget it.

586
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,900
The way you learn as far as I'm concerned

587
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,520
is every time you go to a talk,

588
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,180
you listen not only to the talk, but to

589
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,040
the style that's done.

590
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,700
What talks are effective?

591
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,160
Why were they effective?

592
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,960
What aspects of the speaker can you adapt?

593
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,600
Which brings me to the topic of

594
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,020
communication.

595
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,640
You need to learn to communicate

596
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,040
orally in talks like this. Stop.

597
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,520
And then he

598
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,980
gave this talk a lot of times. This is the

599
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,560
one that's on your YouTube, right?

600
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,460
But there was a text one before and he

601
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,980
said in my early days I think you should

602
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,800
spend as much time in polishing and

603
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,180
presenting as you did in the original

604
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,560
research.

605
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,280
Now at least 50 % of it has to go in the

606
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,600
presentation.

607
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,620
Now if you know Hamming's idea of how do

608
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,440
you encode memory, it's beautifully

609
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,700
presented that almost everybody can

610
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,360
understand. So that was an example of him.

611
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,340
He thought not just came up with the math,

612
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,620
but he laid it out and had a very simple

613
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,340
encoding thing. It's almost like a parlor

614
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,180
trick is you can put a bit pattern in

615
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,780
there and tell you which one is wrong from

616
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,280
the way he does it. He made it very easy

617
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
to understand and as a result, every

618
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,380
single computer in the world

619
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,620
uses his idea.

620
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,800
But that was an example of him following

621
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,520
his own advice.

622
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,520
Yes.

623
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,640
Written?

624
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,480
I think I can get that.

625
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,400
Okay.

626
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,360
Okay, leading a project. Now I'm going to

627
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,120
go through the... I think I said this.

628
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,080
So,

629
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,120
academics have bad benchmarks,

630
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,880
papers,

631
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,780
or maybe even citations rather than impact

632
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,500
is what you're trying to do. I didn't

633
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,020
realize when I started I have six phases

634
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,980
for leading a project and we'll go through

635
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,040
the selecting a problem,

636
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,380
picking a solution, running a project,

637
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,400
finishing a project,

638
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,840
evaluating it and transferring technology.

639
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,760
So let me go through each of those.

640
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
Let's go back to Richard Hamming again.

641
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,240
He's going to talk about... One of the

642
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,420
guys.

643
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,580
And so I said, do you mind if I join you?

644
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,620
So I sit down and we talk about chemistry.

645
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,980
Set the stage here. So here's this pretty

646
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,920
opinionated guy who studies how people can

647
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,680
be great. He's kind of a hobby of his.

648
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,620
At Bell Labs,

649
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,320
one of the greatest research institutions

650
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,560
in the history of this country,

651
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,460
he's been having lunch with physicists,

652
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,140
but they started winning Nobel Prizes

653
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,800
inventing a transistor and things like

654
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,720
that and got promoted.

655
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,140
So he had to find a new group.

656
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
So he decided to hang out with the

657
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,900
chemist. So he just kind of butts his way

658
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,940
in as this outsider

659
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
to talk with the chemist.

660
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,420
Things for a long while.

661
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,260
And finally, one day,

662
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,000
I walk in and say,

663
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,940
if what you're working on is not important

664
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,560
and it's not likely to lead to important

665
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,060
things,

666
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
why are you working on it?

667
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,120
After that, I ate with the engineers.

668
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,720
That was spring. In the fall, going down

669
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,380
the Long Corridor Bell Labs,

670
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,660
my friend chemist got me and said,

671
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,580
you know, Hamming, that remark of yours

672
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
got underneath my skin.

673
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,120
I've spent this summer thinking about the

674
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,980
important problems in my field. I have not

675
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,820
changed my research, but I think it was

676
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,080
well worth the time.

677
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
I say, thank you, Dave, and walk on.

678
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,500
About two weeks later, I know he's made

679
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,160
head of the department.

680
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,900
About 10 or 12 years ago, I know he is a

681
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
member of the National Academy of

682
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,260
Engineering.

683
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,920
I have never heard of anything about any

684
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,300
other person at that chemistry table.

685
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,540
Not one.

686
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,280
The one man who could hear if what you're

687
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,500
doing is not important, not likely

688
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,280
important, why are you doing it? The one

689
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,640
man who could do become important. He did

690
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,040
succeed.

691
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,980
The rest of them who couldn't hear didn't.

692
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,560
It's that simple.

693
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,220
If you don't work on important problems,

694
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,380
you are not going to do important things

695
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,080
except by the dumbest of dumb luck.

696
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,440
And you realize when he's giving these

697
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
talks, the chemist that he was sitting

698
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,740
with were still around and could hear him

699
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,400
give these talks.

700
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,100
That's a charming guy.

701
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, so...

702
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,900
Selecting a problem. When I started at

703
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,300
Berkeley, I just jumped in and I'll tell

704
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,340
you about it in the next one.

705
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,480
Invent a new field and stick to it? No.

706
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,260
Try and do real stuff. Make sure other

707
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,680
people think it's important, not just you.

708
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,940
It's particularly easy to do that in

709
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:30,940
academia.

710
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
You're aiming for this positive impact,

711
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,160
big impact on computer science and

712
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,580
engineering.

713
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,460
And stick to it to your whole career. I

714
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,220
think in this fast, that's not what I did.

715
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,820
In this fast -moving field,

716
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,260
why not instead do a bunch of short

717
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,580
projects? Because a lot of research

718
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
projects aren't going to work.

719
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,200
These things always take longer to expect.

720
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,080
And how are you going to know if you're

721
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,680
working something for 20 years that this

722
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
is going to be an important problem for 20

723
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,420
years?

724
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,200
And what we found by doing lots of five

725
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,720
-year projects is that learning was more

726
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,200
of a number of projects than it was the

727
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
number of years. As you tackle something,

728
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,460
it was the new thing you learned from.

729
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
And then, a lot of times, as I'll say,

730
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,940
research doesn't work out, and you'd like

731
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,420
to fail

732
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,900
sooner rather than fail later.

733
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,700
What's worked well for us is multi

734
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,000
-disciplinary, multi -investigator

735
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,560
projects, trying to have somebody from

736
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,680
multiple fields on a single team.

737
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,020
And then to try and figure out the

738
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,240
strength and weaknesses of your local

739
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,900
environment. Universities are different.

740
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,500
There are strengths that obviously Google

741
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,060
has, and there are weaknesses too. So try

742
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,360
and figure out something that matches your

743
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,780
environment.

744
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,500
And make sure it's exciting that you want

745
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,940
to work on it for several years. And what

746
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,540
I've found is a compelling prototype that

747
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,080
we can build this thing that's really

748
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
going to be amazing is

749
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,120
inspirational.

750
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,760
Okay, so that's selecting the problem.

751
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,540
My first project, when I got to Berkeley

752
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,100
40 years ago, I spent about a week

753
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,880
thinking about it and joined some other

754
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
faculty, and it was ridiculously

755
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
ambitious. Three hardware faculty were

756
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,780
designing our own instruction set, build

757
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,300
our own chips,

758
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
build our own interconnections, network

759
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
switches, boards, systems, operating

760
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,000
systems.

761
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
We didn't have any experience in any of

762
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
it. We didn't have any research funding.

763
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,760
We didn't have any computing or CAD tools.

764
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,080
So what happened from all that? You know,

765
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,740
a couple of papers, right? Not bad for

766
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,020
academics.

767
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,520
Fortunately, I took a sabbatical during

768
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,840
that time, and went away and gave me a

769
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,560
chance to think about things differently.

770
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,960
And I came back and did the risk stuff.

771
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

772
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,900
tenure.

773
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
Picking a solution, let complexity be your

774
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,420
guide.

775
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,020
No,

776
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,460
keep things simple unless you've got a

777
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,760
really good reason not to.

778
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,840
I came up with this phrase early in my

779
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,780
career, is intelligence beams. On any

780
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,320
project, you have a sack of intelligence

781
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,480
beams that you get to spend.

782
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,360
So decide where you want to spend your

783
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,180
intelligence beams.

784
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,460
And then where it doesn't matter, you

785
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,560
know, you can use the common solutions.

786
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,520
And the best result you can possibly get

787
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,740
is afterward for them to say anyone could

788
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
have thought of that, right?

789
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
That doesn't seem so complicated. Anybody

790
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,860
could have thought of it. That you've

791
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
achieved things well.

792
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,180
Complexity costs everything.

793
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,100
You know, longer design, construction,

794
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,100
testing, and debugging.

795
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,620
And these delays lessen the impact of what

796
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,340
you do. So try and keep it simple. It's

797
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,400
hard to keep things simple, but that's the

798
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,600
goal.

799
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,320
The computer scientific,

800
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:24,840
nope.

801
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,040
You want to run experiments to discover

802
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,260
real problems. My friend John Straw says,

803
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,440
you use your intuition to ask questions,

804
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
not to answer them. We're really smart

805
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,480
people. We can make up what we think the

806
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,780
answer is, but that doesn't mean they're

807
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,480
right. What we need is to figure out the

808
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,700
experiments to figure out the real

809
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:40,960
answers.

810
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
So, you know, at Berkeley they asked me,

811
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,280
well, how do you pick a problem and

812
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,640
solution?

813
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,680
What we've done over these years, these

814
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,800
five -year projects is

815
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,740
we start before the end of our project, we

816
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,780
start meeting for at least a year to start

817
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,320
talking about what the next one will be.

818
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,420
We spend that much time thinking about it.

819
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,500
Typically, what we've done is saying, what

820
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,100
are some interesting technology trends

821
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,880
that are happening over the next five or

822
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,680
ten years that will shape the future of

823
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,040
computing, eight to ten years out?

824
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,460
To see if the mix of these trends have

825
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,480
some new opportunity,

826
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,900
for risk, it was probably

827
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,320
computer scientists were being able to do

828
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,760
integrated circuit design.

829
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,160
There was Moore's law that was taking off,

830
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,100
so a 32 -bit microprocessor was plausible.

831
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,160
What's the right way to design such a

832
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,920
microprocessor?

833
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,980
For RAID,

834
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,480
personal computers were getting popular.

835
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,020
They started building hard disks for them,

836
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,760
these cells called small hard disks.

837
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,160
They were being expensive.

838
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,020
Performance for input output was slow.

839
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
Processors were getting faster because of

840
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,260
risk.

841
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,420
Disperformance was slow. Maybe we could do

842
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,360
something with a lot of them.

843
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
For the network of workstation projects,

844
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,240
not only were workstations getting really

845
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,780
fast, but they were beginning to be local

846
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,600
area network switches, could we just build

847
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,500
a big computer out of a bunch of these

848
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,560
components and then how would that work?

849
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,920
Another thing that we've noticed over the

850
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,480
years are when you're all by yourself and

851
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,700
you're going to work in a new field, it's

852
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,120
very scary, but if there's a group of you

853
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,920
with different areas and you kind of go

854
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,340
after this thing, there's kind of safety

855
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,160
in numbers. You aren't all risking your

856
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,980
careers working on machine learning, but

857
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,720
the three of you working together seems

858
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,020
not quite as scary to be able to do that.

859
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,760
The big thing is to, when you've got these

860
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,980
ideas, is to find people whose opinion you

861
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,300
trust and try and get their feedback to

862
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,560
help you shape your vision. You don't have

863
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,360
to do exactly what they say, but you ought

864
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,200
to hear what they're saying.

865
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,620
And then pick a good name.

866
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,260
Apparently in some parallel universe, I'm

867
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,460
in the marketing department, but it's not

868
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,720
that is hard. I have these friends who show

869
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,460
off their Latin education who pick some

870
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,700
name that nobody can possibly spell, and

871
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,460
they even have a word for it now. You pick

872
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,420
the name, and then you

873
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,540
backfill in the acronym, and so they're

874
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,560
called Acronyms, right?

875
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,340
Nobody's ever going to remember that.

876
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,620
One of the projects my younger colleagues

877
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,560
picked is Aspire. It's actually 11 or 12

878
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,920
words. Nobody but him can remember it. So,

879
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,640
if that's true,

880
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,780
you're going to use the acronym model.

881
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,500
It's got to be three or four letters if

882
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,440
anybody's going to remember it.

883
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,140
You want to, the way we do it is put a

884
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
bunch of words on the wall that describes

885
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,640
the project.

886
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,860
Vowels are really valuable, and you want

887
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,000
to try three or four letters?

888
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,400
Three or four letters that are an English

889
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,120
word that kind of have something to do

890
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,000
with the project, so.

891
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,880
But I'm available as a consultant.

892
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,960
Running a project.

893
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Do you want to avoid feedback?

894
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,180
That's one of the themes. No, we do these

895
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,280
periodic project reviews with outsiders.

896
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,080
We've been doing them for 30 years,

897
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,640
twice a year three -day retreat. How many

898
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,820
people here have been to a Berkeley -style

899
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,140
retreat?

900
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,820
All right. That's like a dozen people

901
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,260
here.

902
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,720
And

903
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,440
the outsiders are valued,

904
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,540
and, you know, it's huge benefits to doing

905
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,840
this.

906
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,660
At the end, we get the feedback from

907
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,080
everybody, and we don't argue with that

908
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,620
feedback, but we try to understand it.

909
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,760
It also creates deadlines, which are tough

910
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,620
everywhere,

911
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,860
but particularly academia builds team

912
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,220
spirit.

913
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,660
And

914
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,680
for the people working on it gives them a

915
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,040
chance to communicate and spread their

916
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,500
ideas and interact with others.

917
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,560
Consider a mid-course correction. Our

918
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,260
first project that I was doing was a multi

919
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,920
-processor. The risk ideas were just

920
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,260
starting to catch on, but they hadn't been

921
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
commercial yet. But by midway through the

922
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,140
project, there were commercial chips like

923
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,000
MIPS and Spark.

924
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
We should have

925
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,260
redirected our project to be used to

926
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,840
commercial processors, but I felt like

927
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,720
that was, you know, breaking our promise

928
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,900
and, you know, we should have stuck the

929
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,140
ones that we did customary, but we would

930
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,220
have had a much bigger impact with a multi

931
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,760
-processor

932
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,160
risk project then if we'd used commercial

933
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
instruction sets. So that's part of our

934
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,220
culture now.

935
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,400
It's a five -year project two and a half

936
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,260
years in. Maybe the world has changed in

937
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,700
some way and you should take advantage of

938
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,040
it. An example of that would have been the

939
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,560
Rad Lab, which was a couple of projects

940
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,920
ago we were doing internet services, and

941
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,380
then cloud computing got popular

942
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,940
in it, so we, you know, embraced that, and

943
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,320
that became a big theme of the Rad Lab.

944
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,660
Pick the size of the members of the team

945
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,080
carefully.

946
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,020
You know, tough personalities are hard on

947
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,920
everybody, not just tough personalities or

948
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,760
faculty, even tough personalities for

949
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,060
students, right? You know, it can make it

950
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,320
no fun to come to work, so

951
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,580
try and get good people. I think Berkeley

952
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,680
consciously tries not to hire Prima

953
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,980
Donnas, which makes it nicer.

954
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,400
And if, you know, if you have one expert

955
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,120
per area, it's a little easier. My

956
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,200
colleague Kathy Failed,

957
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,980
I've got opinions about programming

958
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,700
language from piers, but when she speaks,

959
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,800
you know, I listen, right? I don't. And

960
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,160
that makes it easier to do things.

961
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,260
Don't be distracted by others. This is not

962
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,400
going to be so radical for you guys, but

963
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,020
about ten years ago, we went to an open

964
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,100
collaborative thing where we got rid of

965
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,980
faculty offices.

966
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,300
What was happening

967
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,520
is that the students were staying home

968
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,260
because the computers were just as fast

969
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,420
and networks just as fast as home as they

970
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,020
were at work, and whether this is good for

971
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,780
a company or not, I'll leave to you, but

972
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,220
it's terrible for research because it's

973
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,060
not just put your head down and plow

974
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,720
ahead. We've got to talk to people because

975
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,820
you're not sure where you're supposed to

976
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,140
be going.

977
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,640
So we put it into the open space

978
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120
and what, now that I've read about it,

979
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,700
what you're shooting for is communication

980
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,500
and concentration.

981
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,680
So people can come into work, they have to

982
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,920
be able to concentrate enough to get the

983
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
work done, but you want to have

984
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,120
spontaneous communication which leads to

985
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,540
innovation.

986
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,940
So bump into each other and have meeting

987
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,220
rooms.

988
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,820
We've got the meeting rooms optimized for

989
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,560
discussions and phone calls. We came, Jeff

990
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,120
Waltz brought us probably ten years ago

991
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,700
and we saw what you guys did with your

992
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,600
conference rooms and we imitated that.

993
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,360
And

994
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,560
like you guys, we have kitchens and free

995
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,140
drinks. We can't do food but we can do

996
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,400
drinks.

997
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,340
And the amazing thing is it accelerates

998
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,700
research.

999
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,740
Who would have thought space could

1000
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,660
accelerate research?

1001
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,840
It was startling what happened. We went

1002
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,220
from faculty offices that had kind of

1003
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,560
whiteboards there that were filled with

1004
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,160
faculty reminders and you came in and you

1005
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,020
got to work on like one square foot to put

1006
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,360
your idea in there. Instead, we had giant

1007
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,060
whiteboards.

1008
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,000
There was no writing person. You couldn't

1009
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
reserve it in the high-tech way. We copied

1010
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,120
it with cell phones.

1011
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,140
It came stimulating. People came in more.

1012
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,560
There were more spontaneous meetings.

1013
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,940
And then we noticed the zero to 60 time

1014
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,660
for new people went incredibly faster by

1015
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,560
having that kind of environment. So Mata

1016
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,640
Bavaria in his second semester there, he

1017
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,480
gave a talk at Carnegie Mellon. We never

1018
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,980
had anybody do that before. Now Mata

1019
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,160
Bavaria who the founder of Spark did a lot

1020
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,380
of good things but it wasn't obvious then

1021
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,120
that he was going to be that good as it

1022
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,500
turned out. So maybe that had something to

1023
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:45,880
do with it.

1024
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,660
And so Richard Hamming has opinions on

1025
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,000
this based on his experience.

1026
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,100
Which I'm sure you're not surprised. Okay,

1027
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,140
he's got two opinions. The first one is

1028
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,420
open versus closed doors. And the only way

1029
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,480
he can have this opinion was to keep track

1030
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
of all of his colleagues. Which ones kept

1031
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,500
the doors closed? Which ones were open?

1032
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,520
Which ones were successful?

1033
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,920
And he's...

1034
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,480
Here's his idea.

1035
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,420
The example I've given you already is

1036
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,740
working with a door closed or open.

1037
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,860
If you work with your door closed

1038
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,860
you won't be interrupted. You'll get your

1039
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,180
work done.

1040
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,740
You work with your door open. People can

1041
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,540
buy and stop and chat and so on and so on.

1042
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,040
But I've noticed very clearly at Bell

1043
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,460
laboratories,

1044
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,480
those who work with a door shut

1045
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,380
may be working just as hard ten years

1046
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,620
later,

1047
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,740
but they don't know what to work on. They

1048
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,960
are not connected with reality.

1049
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,020
Those who had the door open

1050
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,680
may very well know what's important.

1051
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,420
Now I cannot prove to you whether the open

1052
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,980
door causes the open mind or whether the

1053
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,520
open mind causes the open door.

1054
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,620
I suspect a bill I could only establish

1055
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,220
the correlation.

1056
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,040
And it was quite spectacular.

1057
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
Almost always.

1058
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,280
The guy with the door closed were often

1059
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
very well able.

1060
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
Very gifted, but they seemed to work

1061
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,060
always on slightly the wrong problem.

1062
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,340
So you have to get wide feeling for what

1063
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,920
is going on.

1064
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,220
Okay.

1065
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,760
And then

1066
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,840
he believed that so much that this is how

1067
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,780
his patterns, how he handled Friday

1068
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,980
afternoons, about the importance.

1069
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,080
Especially for researchers, you can start

1070
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,200
to work really hard, but you could miss

1071
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
the really important thing

1072
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,140
by not interacting.

1073
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,220
At the urging of some other people, partly

1074
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,240
and partly in my own,

1075
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,820
I used to set aside Friday noon and Friday

1076
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,200
afternoon for great thoughts.

1077
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,660
Meaning,

1078
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,040
yes, I'll answer a telephone, yes, I'll

1079
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,700
sign a sheet of paper,

1080
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,260
but mainly what is the effect of computing

1081
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,040
on science?

1082
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,660
What the hell am I doing with this

1083
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,140
computing machine?

1084
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,040
How is it going to affect AT AT?

1085
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,540
What should I be doing with computing?

1086
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,500
What is the nature of software?

1087
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,740
My friends all after a while got to know

1088
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,480
Friday afternoon is great thoughts.

1089
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,160
What's the nature of this and that and the

1090
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,420
other thing?

1091
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,420
I spent 10 % of my time trying to answer

1092
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,480
the question of what are the important

1093
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,440
problems in my field?

1094
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,480
10 % Friday afternoon straight through.

1095
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,160
Don't do it Monday morning because you'll

1096
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,840
be interrupted immediately.

1097
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,720
If you do it Friday afternoon, someone can

1098
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,180
link it over on to Saturday and Sunday. If

1099
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,680
you do it Monday morning, there's a hot

1100
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,060
conference at 10 o 'clock and bingo,

1101
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,280
everything is broken up.

1102
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,980
I use it Friday afternoon for many, many

1103
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,560
years. I recommend that you find a regular

1104
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,940
time to stop and think

1105
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,900
what are the important things? What is

1106
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,040
going on? What is the nature of what you

1107
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,300
are doing?

1108
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,100
What is the characteristic of the job?

1109
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,600
What are the fundamentals behind it? So

1110
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
you'll have some idea

1111
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,240
where you're headed so you can march in a

1112
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
uniform direction and get far rather than

1113
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,700
being a drunken sailor and getting

1114
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,040
nowhere.

1115
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,800
You're free to not ignore the advice but

1116
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,880
then your career is that of a drunken

1117
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,320
sailor.

1118
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,880
Okay, finishing your project. I'll talk

1119
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,620
about this some.

1120
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,200
If people count the number of projects you

1121
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,440
finish, not the ones you start.

1122
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,840
In successful

1123
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,600
projects, go through this unglamorous hard

1124
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,260
phase of trying to finish it.

1125
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,600
It's because design is a lot more fun.

1126
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,980
It's a lot more fun to design things to

1127
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,640
make stuff work.

1128
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,660
But, you know, some positive things. Fred

1129
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,600
Brooks, one of my heroes says there's no

1130
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,640
winners on a losing team. No losers on a

1131
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,900
winning team. If you win, anybody

1132
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,660
involved, no matter what they did, they

1133
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:28,920
win.

1134
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,780
Improve productivity of team members. How

1135
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,480
can you do that?

1136
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,180
Organize each day. When are you figuring

1137
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,220
out when you're most alert?

1138
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,240
When you need an app or exercise or sleep?

1139
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,140
When? How often should you be reading and

1140
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,500
writing,

1141
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,820
programming and email?

1142
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,820
And what I found for successful

1143
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,840
colleagues, they always used to do this,

1144
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,280
you know, daily, weekly and even every six

1145
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,580
months to see how they're doing on their

1146
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:55,900
career.

1147
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,720
These days, there's this idea of agile

1148
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,940
scrum where you meet in the same place at

1149
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,920
the same time and do sprints. I think this

1150
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,900
is a pretty effective model.

1151
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,860
And then reduce the projects of slate.

1152
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,620
Again, Fred Brooks said adding people to a

1153
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,400
late project makes it later in his classic

1154
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,580
book, The Mythical Manhunt.

1155
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,500
And finishing a project is how you acquire

1156
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,380
taste. How do you get good taste? If you

1157
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,000
don't finish it, you don't know really

1158
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
what went wrong. It helps you pick good

1159
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,280
problems and find simple solutions.

1160
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,840
Okay. And then my friend John Hennessy, I

1161
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:28,920
guess

1162
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,020
at President Stamford said this a long

1163
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,900
time ago, you can quickly tell whether or

1164
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,440
not the authors have ever built something

1165
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,100
and made it work.

1166
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,300
And if you never make it work, you don't

1167
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,180
acquire that taste.

1168
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,900
Evaluating quantitatively never be proven

1169
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,260
wrong.

1170
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,000
Nope. If you can't be proven wrong, then

1171
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,820
you can't be proven right.

1172
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,080
And you have to, you know, we need

1173
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,780
reproducible results. You're trying to get

1174
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,100
people to use your ideas. If they can't

1175
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,220
reproduce them, they're not going to take

1176
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,000
your word for it.

1177
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,320
And, you know, for better, for worse,

1178
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,940
benchmarks to shape our field, and

1179
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,880
especially in the commercial world, if we

1180
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,120
have good ones that accelerate progress,

1181
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,900
bad ones, then there's a choice between

1182
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,360
helping sales or helping customers, and

1183
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,440
often sales wins.

1184
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,360
And then transferring technology. It's not

1185
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,620
just you write a paper and everybody

1186
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,440
starts using it.

1187
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,940
You have to go out and stump it.

1188
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,780
You know, this last year, there's a risk

1189
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,120
five, which is an effort to be able to

1190
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,020
have an open instruction set so that be an

1191
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,060
open alternative, kind of like Linux is to

1192
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,840
Microsoft Windows.

1193
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,440
So I gave talks at, you know,

1194
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,040
at ten universities this fall trying to

1195
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,360
get the word out. Then if they kind of

1196
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,000
like the ideas, then they read the papers.

1197
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,460
Of course, you know, if you don't pick a

1198
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,980
good problem, people aren't going to be

1199
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,480
that interested.

1200
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,720
And you can tell if it's a good problem if

1201
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,180
more people get interested over time

1202
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,460
rather than yours starts to do that. I

1203
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,880
think I'm persuasive. The way I change

1204
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,980
minds is with believable numbers. And so

1205
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,840
you have to collect that quantitatively

1206
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,880
and believe it. The other thing I learned

1207
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,520
late in my career is your personality

1208
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,760
affects technology transfer. There's this

1209
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,040
person who I won't name who had a bunch of

1210
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,120
interesting ideas and people wouldn't use

1211
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,320
them. And I talked to people in the

1212
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,680
industry about they hated that guy.

1213
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,300
They hated that guy. If there was any

1214
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,520
other way to do it at all, they would use

1215
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,080
it because that would the last thing they

1216
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,220
would do. So you could be a jerk if you

1217
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,320
have the only possible solution, but it's

1218
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,380
kind of hard to do that in computing.

1219
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,960
Maybe in biology you can do that.

1220
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,020
And then product groups, people don't want

1221
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,280
to change. Product groups, there's risk

1222
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,200
associated with change. Let's work for us

1223
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,200
and this goes back.

1224
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,620
So Fred Brooks, when he was a graduate

1225
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,440
student, his advice was Howard Aiken.

1226
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,200
And Fred Brooks said, I think these people

1227
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,600
are going to steal your idea. These

1228
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,680
companies are looking at his idea at

1229
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Harvard University, a drum memory system.

1230
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,600
Watch out, Howard. And Aiken said in some

1231
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,800
of the actions, the problem in this

1232
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,340
business isn't to keep people from

1233
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,880
stealing your ideas. It's making them

1234
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,600
steal your ideas.

1235
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,400
That's still true today 65 years later.

1236
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
So what's worked for us is to find one

1237
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,300
bold group, often not the leaders, but

1238
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,600
some bold group willing to take a shot on

1239
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,300
it and they are successful.

1240
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,740
And then kind of the rest of the field is,

1241
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,580
well, and for us,

1242
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,520
it was Sun Microsystems for Risk and EMC

1243
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,700
for RAID and INC to me and then Google for

1244
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,760
Networks of Workstations.

1245
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,700
But it's kind of like the rest of the

1246
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,360
field, oh, damn

1247
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,640
they tried it. It works. Okay, we'll

1248
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,220
change, right?

1249
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,880
People don't really,

1250
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,980
as much as people enjoy ideas, they don't

1251
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,580
want to take the risk. And then the other

1252
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,400
way of transferring technology is to start

1253
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,820
a company.

1254
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,940
In my 40 years, everybody I've talked to

1255
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,480
who's worked for a startup likes it doing

1256
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,820
it once.

1257
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
They absolutely, now there's some people

1258
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,760
who love doing it more than once. A lot of

1259
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,600
people once is enough.

1260
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,460
But everybody thinks it was useful, they

1261
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,020
learn a lot.

1262
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,960
And then if it works, you know, if it

1263
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,320
works out, you see not just your ideas,

1264
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,660
but the product and of course you can

1265
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,060
potentially make a lot of money that works

1266
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,280
out and become famous.

1267
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,000
The downsides are that, you know, you

1268
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,860
learn about things you might not want to

1269
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,240
learn about,

1270
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:06,680
but

1271
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,820
particularly lawsuits,

1272
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,880
my friends who have lawsuits,

1273
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,320
that's less fun.

1274
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,840
And you don't get to do research and

1275
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,240
development.

1276
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,340
And then only 10 % of the startups make

1277
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,040
it. But nevertheless, everybody thinks it

1278
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,880
was worth it for once in their life, maybe

1279
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,420
when you're younger.

1280
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
So I didn't really realize that there were

1281
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,120
six roles to being a leader of a project

1282
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,400
and it changes over time.

1283
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,720
But that's what I believe now. Now

1284
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,100
so wrapping things up and there's time for

1285
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,600
questions

1286
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,700
here is the goal is to have impact is to

1287
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,720
change the way people do computing and

1288
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,280
engineering positively. Now,

1289
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,420
we do these five -year projects. Now that

1290
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,460
my career is

1291
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,280
ending,

1292
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
I will do 12, right? They overlap. So I

1293
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,420
have been there 40 years, not 60 years.

1294
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,760
You can't tell if a project is successful

1295
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,740
for at least 10 years.

1296
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,700
And the good news is three of them look

1297
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,880
like they're pretty successful.

1298
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,120
They're 10 years old. So that's like kind

1299
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,860
of 25 % batting average, which is why I'm

1300
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,820
glad I did a lot of projects.

1301
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,880
There's two that are finished,

1302
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,760
but haven't been 10 years. The Rad Lab did

1303
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
spark and mess.

1304
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,220
Those seem promising.

1305
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,700
The Par Lab did communication avoiding

1306
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,820
algorithms and demo and this RISC -5

1307
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,120
stuff.

1308
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,280
But, you know, it will take five or seven

1309
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,880
years to know how significant it was. So

1310
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,120
maybe I'll get up to, you know, five out

1311
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,760
of 12, which is like 40%. But most of the

1312
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,360
projects don't work, so I'm glad I did

1313
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:30,940
short projects.

1314
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,400
So solve a problem other people care

1315
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,500
about. You taste that you acquire by

1316
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,320
finishing projects and then

1317
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,320
whoops.

1318
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,140
And so, okay.

1319
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,720
And I think the key theme of running over

1320
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,780
my career is feedback. It's figuring out

1321
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,560
ways to get feedback. Okay, with that, I'm

1322
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,340
ready for questions.

1323
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,880
APPLAUSE

1324
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,980
I think there's a microphone here.

1325
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,380
Okay, questions.

1326
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,040
Without the first question, there won't be

1327
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,140
multiple questions.

1328
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:04,960
Oh, there it is.

1329
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,460
Since you asked for hard questions, which

1330
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,200
of your projects did you enjoy the most

1331
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,520
and which of them do you think had the

1332
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:14,940
most impact?

1333
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,280
Which did I enjoy the most?

1334
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,820
Let me do the most impact.

1335
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,800
Because I'm kind of wrapping things up,

1336
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,120
its plausible raid had the biggest

1337
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,580
impact.

1338
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,220
It's everybody uses it.

1339
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,300
You know, the original raid paper won

1340
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,800
three

1341
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,440
test of time awards.

1342
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,400
You know, if I had, it looks to me, if I

1343
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,140
try to be a neutral observer, probably

1344
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,000
raid is the most significant so far. Which

1345
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,200
one did I enjoy the most?

1346
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,700
I try to always make projects that I

1347
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,120
really love. I try to make projects that

1348
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,380
if I was a graduate student, I just died

1349
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,300
to work on this project.

1350
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,840
You know,

1351
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,140
that's hard.

1352
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,260
Maybe... Yeah, what are you about to do? I

1353
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,320
don't know. The good thing about all the

1354
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,720
projects, whether they're home

1355
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,380
runs, is they produce great students.

1356
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,760
And I didn't say that in the slide.

1357
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,580
There's almost 300 students in those 12

1358
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,820
projects that have,

1359
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,580
which was

1360
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,400
I had fun adding that number up.

1361
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,500
Jeff.

1362
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,280
So this isn't really a problem for most of

1363
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,900
us here, but would you give different

1364
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,580
advice to a pre -tenure academic versus a

1365
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,520
post -tenure academic? Or do you think you

1366
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,980
can do the kinds of things you're talking

1367
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,800
about and not compromise your chances of

1368
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,860
getting tenure? Yeah, so people ask me to

1369
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,520
say something. So when Hennessy and I did

1370
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,180
the risk stuff, which at the time was

1371
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,100
hugely controversial. If you think deep

1372
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,340
neural networks are controversial,

1373
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:51,600
people,

1374
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,120
a faculty member of another institution

1375
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,020
wrote a hit piece on me personally, Dave

1376
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,420
Patterson's a bad person about, and we

1377
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,840
were talking about instruction set design.

1378
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,420
But at the time Hennessy and I were saying

1379
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,920
digital equipment, one of the leading

1380
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,660
computer manufacturers in the world, had a

1381
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,800
pretty stupid design.

1382
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,560
So we

1383
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,180
didn't worry about that.

1384
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,120
Also, you have to believe in what you're

1385
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,580
doing.

1386
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,860
I just can't give the advice to do

1387
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,580
something that

1388
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,800
you don't believe in

1389
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,020
and work on that because in fact when I

1390
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,800
visited universities and I've seen that,

1391
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,940
it's an assistant professor telling me, well

1392
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,120
I don't really like what I'm working on,

1393
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,560
but this is what I have to do to get

1394
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,000
tenure and then I go talk to the chairman

1395
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,720
and this guy is just doing incremental

1396
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,040
stuff. He's never going to get tenure,

1397
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,520
right? There's that gap there.

1398
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,700
You know, when you're larval, you need to

1399
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,600
make sure you publish,

1400
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,480
you know, you need to go around and give

1401
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,640
talks and stuff like that. But I think you

1402
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,620
got to do projects you believe in.

1403
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,840
Life's too short to work on. Yeah,

1404
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,600
question here?

1405
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,060
So you mentioned a couple of times

1406
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,460
not to be a prima donna.

1407
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,200
So it's easy to identify other people

1408
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,000
being prima donnas. But how do you tell if

1409
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,980
you're being a prima donna?

1410
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,760
Are you married?

1411
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,820
My family's perfect at pointing out my

1412
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,140
flaws.

1413
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,680
Well, I think

1414
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,700
feedback is the one I go out of my way to

1415
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,920
get feedback. If somebody hates my papers,

1416
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,980
I send them new papers because they tell

1417
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,520
me the honest thing to do. I would like to

1418
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,820
think if I'm acting like a jerk that, you

1419
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,540
know, I'm pretty sure my friends or my

1420
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,140
family would

1421
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,620
tell me that. I think you could ask.

1422
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,860
I think you can ask, right?

1423
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,280
Geez, people are afraid to tell you

1424
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,140
something if not, but I think if you ask

1425
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,820
did I handle that well or not, you can do

1426
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:50,980
it.

1427
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,740
I think some people in academia think

1428
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,840
that's the way you,

1429
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,340
that's the way people know that you're

1430
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,880
famous. You've had some success, you start

1431
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
acting differently and it's just bad

1432
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,160
career advice.

1433
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,600
Okay, other questions?

1434
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,200
So full disclosure, I went to Brooklyn and

1435
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,300
experienced one of these projects.

1436
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,940
Amin was on the network workstation

1437
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,400
project. I'm biased toward the model. My

1438
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,040
question is, given the success of the

1439
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,340
model, why do you think more

1440
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,200
universities haven't adopted it?

1441
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,680
I mean, even though it seems like the

1442
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,700
stuff you're saying is really obvious,

1443
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,240
it's also somewhat rare.

1444
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:25,940
Yeah,

1445
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,040
I got that exact same question at

1446
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,240
Berkeley.

1447
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,380
I think this time I'll be less humble.

1448
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,340
You need to, you have to have somebody

1449
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,000
who's willing to lead,

1450
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,600
right?

1451
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,540
For some reason, even though wrestling,

1452
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,500
as I'll tell you, I wrestled in high

1453
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,040
school and college as an individual sport,

1454
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,980
I had great wrestling coaches who realized

1455
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,060
we'd be more successful if we bonded as a

1456
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,360
team,

1457
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,200
even though it was an individual sport. So

1458
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,360
I had that kind of role model going up and

1459
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,940
so I think I'm good at kind of organizing

1460
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,680
teams. So you have to have somebody who's

1461
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,100
willing to do that.

1462
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,180
The institution itself, Berkeley

1463
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,640
told me day one have impact.

1464
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,680
They didn't have any problem with multiple

1465
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,920
people working on it. When you're an

1466
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,580
assistant professor,

1467
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,580
you make up rules like I have to have only

1468
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,200
sold off in papers, otherwise they're

1469
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,280
going to credit, but that's not true. So

1470
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,380
the institution let us happen.

1471
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,320
I think it was helpful that I'm a good

1472
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,300
leader of people, but there's lots of good

1473
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,860
leaders of people around. I don't

1474
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,300
understand why that doesn't happen more.

1475
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,220
It seems common sense.

1476
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,500
It's not like I've kept this a secret for

1477
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,400
40 years. I've been telling people at

1478
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,060
Lawson Institution.

1479
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,860
I'm not sure, but we're a lunatic fringe,

1480
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,020
right? We put a group together. It's a

1481
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,980
different group with interdisciplinary mix

1482
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,660
and match. We tackle a problem.

1483
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,680
We've already visited you guys on the next

1484
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,320
project to get some feedback on it. I

1485
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,540
don't know why more people don't do it.

1486
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,240
You have to ask them.

1487
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,280
You should ask them.

1488
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,920
Why don't you guys act like Berkeley? I'm

1489
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,560
sure they'd love that.

1490
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,500
There's probably a nearby university.

1491
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,580
There's probably a nearby university.

1492
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,100
I think we have about five or six more

1493
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,240
minutes.

1494
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,320
With that, I need to give

1495
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,380
quickly

1496
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,100
my life story.

1497
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,460
I'm an accidental CS student. I was a math

1498
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,160
major and wrestler in high school and

1499
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,540
college.

1500
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,200
At the end of my junior year, the math

1501
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,260
class was canceled. I had to take a

1502
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,380
course. There was no CS major. I just took

1503
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,480
an intro to computer science

1504
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,260
and I was hooked. That was it. My senior

1505
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,080
year, I took every computer course I

1506
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,260
could.

1507
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,840
I'm an accidental student. I went to UCLA.

1508
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,880
I casually mentioned at the end of one of

1509
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,120
those courses to a new Ph. D. I'd rather

1510
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,920
do this than work in a factory to pay my

1511
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,020
college. He on his own went and found me a

1512
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,340
job as an undergraduate student.

1513
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,200
While I was an undergraduate student, even

1514
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,640
though it was near the end of my senior

1515
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,040
year, that wasn't too late to go to

1516
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,020
graduate school. I asked my wife about

1517
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,240
master's degree. She said, sure, it's only

1518
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:57,860
four or five quarters.

1519
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,920
When I got into the office, everybody else

1520
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,760
in my office was getting a Ph. D. So I

1521
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,040
thought maybe I should get a Ph. D. So I

1522
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,240
decided to do that.

1523
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,820
We lived on a research assistant salary

1524
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,700
with my wife and two kids and I. We were

1525
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,140
at, you know, poverty level at that time.

1526
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,540
And then the project ended. I lost my R

1527
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:17,860
. A. ship.

1528
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,680
My advisor helped get me a job at an

1529
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,280
aerospace company whose aircraft.

1530
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,100
And then it was touch and go whether I had

1531
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,000
finished my Ph. D. because I was working

1532
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,100
20, 30, 40 hours. But I did mean it.

1533
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,000
I'm an accidental Berkeley professor.

1534
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,100
My wife grew up in,

1535
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,520
right next door to Berkeley and when I was

1536
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,940
graduating on the interview tour, she

1537
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,700
says, I can't help but think you ended up

1538
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,640
with Berkeley. And I said, look,

1539
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,760
Berkeley's up here.

1540
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,300
UCLA's down here. I'm graduating. This is

1541
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,160
never going to happen. But she forced me

1542
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,320
as a graduate student to call the chairman

1543
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,100
of the department at Berkeley Computer

1544
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,280
Science to find out about my application.

1545
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,600
So I called this guy.

1546
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,700
He said, well, Dave, you're in the top

1547
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,140
ten, but not top five. And at the time I'm

1548
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,300
thinking, wow, that wasn't so bad.

1549
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,500
So turns out, he said that to anybody who

1550
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:05,740
called.

1551
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,180
But then he took my application.

1552
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,420
Yeah, that seems interesting. Handed it to

1553
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,480
somebody visiting Southern California.

1554
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,680
We had a good conversation. They invited

1555
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,080
me back to the interview and got a job

1556
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,340
offer.

1557
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,620
I

1558
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,260
barely got tenure.

1559
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,180
The first project I already told you about

1560
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,040
was way too ambitious.

1561
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,540
I did the sabbatical and did the wrist

1562
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:27,840
stuff.

1563
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,260
Tenure wasn't easy. I was one of those

1564
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,060
guys that was using conferences where the

1565
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,000
whole campus used journals but us. So I

1566
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,260
was the guinea pig that went through that

1567
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,540
and the wrist stuff was pretty new, but I

1568
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,280
got it. After that, things got better.

1569
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,920
But I still get papers rejected by those

1570
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,080
jerks on the programming committee.

1571
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,260
And so what have I learned? What works for

1572
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:46,460
me?

1573
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,100
For me, it was maximizing personal

1574
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,000
happiness versus personal wealth. That's

1575
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,800
always been my guideline.

1576
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,040
Believe in this country, you think wealth

1577
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,580
is happiness.

1578
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,280
There's unhappy billionaires, right? In

1579
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,360
this world. They're not the same thing.

1580
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,840
Family first, especially in that kind of

1581
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,900
job. You know, people ask you do things or

1582
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,720
family can go down the list. I made my

1583
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,460
family first. We had my wife and I, two

1584
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,980
sons. So I did Indian guides.

1585
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,040
I was the cup scout leader. I was the

1586
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,420
soccer coach when there were field trips

1587
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:16,700
out there.

1588
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,560
So when my rebellious teenage boy grew up,

1589
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,720
ah, you were never there. And I said,

1590
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,520
Indian guides, cup scouts.

1591
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,600
So I went down the list. He said, oh,

1592
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,320
okay, maybe.

1593
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,860
Passion, courage, and optimism. You might

1594
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,700
be able to tell I'm a passionate guy. I

1595
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,600
have to believe the thing I'm doing is

1596
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,440
going to possibly change the world.

1597
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,780
My optimism story goes back to high

1598
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,080
school.

1599
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,660
I started dating this girl who was dating

1600
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,500
older guys who had corvettes and stuff

1601
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,000
like that.

1602
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,760
Nevertheless, after a couple of years and

1603
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,440
a couple of updates, I asked her

1604
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,580
if she would go steady with me.

1605
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,480
I was really sad at the time.

1606
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,980
She'd just been dating older guys and

1607
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,820
didn't know what to say. She said, well, I

1608
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,820
don't know how to say no. So me, being an

1609
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,880
optimist and logical person, Nana knows a

1610
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,560
yes. So I said, great, and I hugged her.

1611
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,600
And she said, you know,

1612
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,920
I'll let this guy down later. But we've

1613
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,960
been married 48 years now. So I think

1614
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,300
that's okay.

1615
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,060
And then, yeah, I think we swing for the

1616
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,440
fences, right? That's that thing.

1617
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,760
Now, another thing. This is a saying that

1618
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,020
a colleague told me that it's actually a

1619
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,580
couple hundred years old. Friends come and

1620
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,600
go, but enemies accumulate.

1621
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,540
So this kind of... Ironically, the

1622
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,880
physical courage that comes with wrestling

1623
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:31,940
has,

1624
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,980
to me, been intellectual courage. So when

1625
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,300
I was president of ACM,

1626
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,900
the person in charge of DARPA was cutting

1627
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,160
back on academic funding.

1628
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,640
So I decided to take him on with my friend

1629
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,160
at Belozoska in Washington. And we tried

1630
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,480
to get people from other universities to

1631
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,520
join us. But they were afraid this guy

1632
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,240
would be vengeful and cut him off, I

1633
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,900
think, with good reason. So it was just us

1634
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,060
taking him on with editorials and science

1635
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,680
and stuff. So this guy was not a fan of

1636
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,060
us. But we hadn't quite realized this is

1637
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:58,700
unintentional.

1638
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,500
But the other saying is the enemy of my

1639
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,260
enemy is my friend. So we made a lot of

1640
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:03,500
friends.

1641
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,380
But keep that in mind.

1642
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,440
Winning as a team versus an individual. In

1643
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,780
my DNA,

1644
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,100
I believe a team of, you know, average

1645
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,020
people can work together and beat

1646
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,740
superstars.

1647
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,280
And then I've already quoted Fred Brooks

1648
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,960
about that line.

1649
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,820
Seek out honest feedback and learn from

1650
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,820
it. It's easy to avoid feedback. But

1651
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,900
that's how you get better.

1652
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,600
The one warning sign I can pass on from my

1653
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,420
fourth years

1654
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,980
always dangerous is when somebody thinks

1655
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,960
that there's the smartest person in the

1656
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,620
room. There's a person in my field who

1657
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,860
thinks he's the smartest person in the

1658
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,000
room and everybody hates that guy. There

1659
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,980
was a president of a university who

1660
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,680
thought he's the smartest. That person was

1661
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,840
fired for doing a lousy job.

1662
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,400
The people who founded Enron

1663
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,680
thought they were the smartest people in

1664
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,640
the room. They went to prison and I even

1665
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,160
have a relative who thought he was the

1666
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,440
smartest

1667
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,820
person in the room and he's a convicted

1668
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,640
felon. So why would that be? Why would

1669
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,320
this person be probably smart? If they

1670
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,680
think they're the smartest, why would it

1671
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,380
be such a bad sign? I think it's that they

1672
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,720
don't want feedback from anybody. If

1673
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,780
you're the smartest person in the room,

1674
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,740
you don't need to talk to anybody about

1675
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,200
your ideas. But anyway, run away if you

1676
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,120
find something like that.

1677
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,780
This thing happened to me. It was like God

1678
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,360
spoken my ear one morning.

1679
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,980
I remember waking up and it's not how many

1680
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,100
projects you start. It's how many you

1681
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,600
finish. It was like in my head.

1682
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,580
Like somebody was telling me what to do.

1683
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,560
Ever since that, that's what I've done.

1684
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,040
What I do is one big project at a time. I

1685
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,640
do other things, but there's one big thing

1686
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,280
at a time. When Hennessy and I were doing

1687
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,800
our textbook,

1688
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,020
that was the big thing that I did that

1689
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,240
year.

1690
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,080
When I was president of ACM,

1691
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,220
I took a sabbatical, so that was the one

1692
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,400
big thing I did there that year. It turns

1693
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,940
out if you do one big thing a year,

1694
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,460
over 30 years you can get a lot of things

1695
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:56,680
done.

1696
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,560
A lot of academics, particularly, will

1697
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,640
work on a thousand things at once and not

1698
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,660
finish for many of them.

1699
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:03,840
And then

1700
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,700
have fun.

1701
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,660
To be successful, you do have to work

1702
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,060
hard. Our long-lost

1703
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,780
colleague Jim Gray,

1704
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,280
even in his 60s, he'd do one all night or

1705
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,740
a month. So you have to work hard to be

1706
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,520
successful. But you have to have fun.

1707
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,300
As far as we know, you only get one chance

1708
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,860
of this and if you get to the end without

1709
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,460
having any fun, you've wasted a lot of

1710
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,900
opportunities. I can put up a lot of

1711
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,400
stuff. As long as I play soccer every

1712
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,680
Sunday,

1713
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,100
I can have a good time. So that's my

1714
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,400
advice.

1715
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,580
Thanks very much.
