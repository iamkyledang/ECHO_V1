1
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,860
hear that that's nothing which is what I

2
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,700
as a speaker at today's conference have

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,760
for you all I have nothing not a zip zilch

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,420
Zippo nothing smart nothing inspirational

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,900
nothing even remotely researched at all I

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,060
have absolutely nothing to say whatsoever

7
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,600
and yet through my manner of speaking I

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,900
will make it seem like I do like what I am

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,620
saying is brilliant and maybe just maybe

10
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,420
you will feel like you've learned

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,580
something now I'm going to get started with

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,200
the opening I'm going to make a lot of hand

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,140
gestures I'm going to do this with my right

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,000
hand I'm going to do this with my left I'm

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,480
going to adjust my glasses and then I'm gonna

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,600
ask you all a question by show of hands

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,640
how many of you all have been asked a

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,620
question before okay great I'm seeing some

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,020
hands and again I have nothing here

20
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,420
and act like I'm telling you a personal

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,880
anecdote.

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,280
Something to break the tension,

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,840
something to endear myself a little bit,

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,280
something kind of embarrassing.

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,120
Ha ha ha.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,460
And you guys are going to make an aww

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,740
sound.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,980
It's true. It really happened.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,500
And now I'm going to bring it to a broader

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,880
point.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm going to really back in.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,220
I'm going to make it intellectual.

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm going to bring it to this man right

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:53,840
here.

35
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,660
Now, what this man did was important, I'm

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,980
sure.

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,180
Ha ha ha. But I, for one, have no idea who

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,620
he is.

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,820
I simply Google images the word, scientist.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,800
Ha ha ha. And now you see, I'd like it to

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,140
seem like I'm making points,

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,680
building an argument,

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,840
inspiring you to change your life, when in

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,220
reality this is just me buying time.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
believe me let's take a look at the

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,820
numbers this is a real thing that's

47
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,720
happening right now the number of talks

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,320
that I'm giving is one interesting facts

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,160
imparted thus far in said talk well that's

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,280
going to be a zero my height in inches is 70

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
.5 note the point five there two times six

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,220
equals 12 and then interestingly enough

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,560
six times two also equals 12 that's math

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,820
352 is a three-digit number one two three

55
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,220
four five

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,650
Now,

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,390
to add more filler here, I'm going to give

58
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,550
you a couple more numbers to consider.

59
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,150
18, 237,

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,490
5, 601,

61
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,970
2 .6 million,

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,470
4,

63
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,650
4,

64
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,890
24,

65
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,950
staggering.

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,630
These are real numbers, all of them.

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,750
And to follow that up, let's take a look

68
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,910
at some graphs. Now, if you take a look at

69
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,150
this pie chart, what you're going to see

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,850
is that the majority far exceeds the

71
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,230
minority.

72
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,210
Everybody see that?

73
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,150
Cool, isn't it?

74
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,310
And let's take a look at this bar graph,

75
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,230
because it shows similarly irrelevant

76
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,750
data.

77
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,310
Now, I'm doing this because I'd like to

78
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,750
make it seem like I've done my homework.

79
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,210
If you were, say, watching this on YouTube

80
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,130
with the sound off, you might think, huh,

81
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,990
okay, this guy knows what he's talking

82
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,330
about,

83
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,450
but I don't. I'm flying.

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,720
I've got nothing. I'm a total and utter

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
phony, but you know what?

86
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,720
I was offered a TED talk and

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,760
Damn it. I'm going to see it through

88
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,340
Now if you take a look behind me, these

89
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,300
are just words paired with vaguely thought

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,560
-provoking stock photos

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,220
I'm gonna point at them like I'm making

92
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,040
use both of my time and your time

93
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,830
I don't know what half of them mean.

94
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,570
I'm just gonna start saying gibberish.

95
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,060
Gabba,

96
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,020
turkey,

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,500
mouth in a mouth,

98
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,700
chip,

99
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,440
trip, my dog skip,

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,340
rip it and dip it, Richard.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm an Kitty bitty baby bopper, and I'm

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,380
hungry in my tum.

103
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,080
Brad Pitt,

104
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,220
Uma Thurman,

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
names, things,

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,520
words, words, and more things. And see, it

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,140
feels like it might make sense, doesn't

108
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,400
it?

109
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,560
Like maybe, just maybe, I'm building to

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,380
some sort of satisfying conclusion. I

111
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,000
mean, I'm gesticulating as though I am.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,380
I'm pacing, I'm growing in intensity. I'm

113
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,900
taking off my glasses, which, by the way,

114
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,520
are just frames.

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,900
I wore them to look smart, even though my

116
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,240
vision is perfect.

117
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,900
And now I'm going to slow things down a

118
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,180
little bit.

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm going to change the tone.

120
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm going to make it seem like I'm

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
building to a moment.

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,740
And what if I was?

123
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,240
Amazing, isn't it? What can you do?

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,980
Life's a roller coaster.

125
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
You know, if there's one thing you take

126
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,540
away from my talk, I'd like you to think

127
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,560
about what you heard at the beginning.

128
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,160
And I'd like you to think about what you

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,760
hear now.

130
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,720
Because it was nothing,

131
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,200
and it's still nothing. Think about that.

132
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,500
Or don't. That's fine.

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,720
And now I'm going to stop talking.

134
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,780
Thank you.
