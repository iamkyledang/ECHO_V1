1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,340
So in college,

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,460
I was a government major, which means I

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,580
had to write a lot of papers.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,900
Now when a normal student writes a paper,

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,040
they might spread the work-out a little

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,540
like this.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,240
So, you know,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,480
you get started maybe a little slowly, but

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,100
you get enough done in the first week that

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,720
with some heavier days later on,

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,620
everything gets done and things stay

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:33,960
civil.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,780
And I would want to do that like that.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,940
That would be the plan.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,240
I would have it all ready to go, but then

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,580
actually the paper would come along and

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,540
then I would kind of do this.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,120
And that would happen in every single

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,460
paper.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,900
But then came my 90 -page senior thesis,

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
a paper you're supposed to spend a year

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,200
on.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,580
I knew for a paper like that, my normal

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,960
workflow was not an option, it was way too

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
big a project. So I planned things out and

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,500
I decided I kind of had to go something

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
like this.

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,380
This is how the year would go. So I'd

29
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,360
start off light and I'd bump it up in the

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,220
middle months and then at the end, I would

31
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,660
kick it up into high gear, just like a

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,140
little staircase.

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,000
How hard could it be to just walk up the

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,340
stairs?

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,000
No big deal, right?

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,100
But then, the funniest thing happened, those

37
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,860
first few months,

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,620
they came and went and I couldn't quite do

39
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:28,980
stuff.

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,240
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,340
And then those middle months actually went

42
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,780
by and I didn't really write words and so

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,260
we were here.

44
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,700
And then two months turned into one month,

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,240
turned into two weeks.

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,760
And one day I woke up with three days

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
until the deadline,

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,980
still not having written a word

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,880
and so I did the only thing I could.

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,420
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,900
not one but two all-nighters, humans are

52
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,640
not supposed to pull two all-nighters,

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
sprinted across campus,

54
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,960
dove in slow motion and got it in just at

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,400
the deadline.

56
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,240
I thought that was the end of everything.

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,980
But a week later, I get a call.

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,340
It's a school.

59
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,520
And they say, is this Tim Urban? And I

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,280
say, yeah.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
And they say, we need to talk about your

62
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,420
thesis.

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,900
And I say, OK.

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,060
And they say,

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,500
that's the best one we've ever seen.

66
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,740
That did not.

67
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,990
It was a very, very bad thesis.

68
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,510
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,410
when all of you thought, this guy is

70
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,050
amazing.

71
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,030
No, no, it was very, very bad.

72
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,710
Anyway,

73
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,310
today I'm a writer,

74
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,430
blogger, guy.

75
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,110
I write the blog, Wait But Why.

76
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,650
And a couple of years ago, I decided to

77
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,830
write about procrastination.

78
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,150
My behavior has always perplexed the non

79
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,010
-procrastinators around me, and I wanted

80
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,870
to explain to the non -procrastinators of

81
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,410
the world what goes on in the heads of

82
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,850
procrastinators and why we are the way we

83
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,470
are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the

84
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,190
brains of procrastinators were actually

85
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,650
different from the brains of other people.

86
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,170
And to test this, I found an MRI lab that

87
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,870
actually let me scan both my brain and the

88
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,470
brain of a proven non -procrastinator.

89
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,830
And so I could compare them, and I

90
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,190
actually brought them here to show you

91
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,490
today, and I want you to take a look

92
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,990
carefully to see if you can notice a

93
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,130
difference. And I know that if you're not

94
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,870
a trained brain expert, it's not that

95
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,790
obvious, but just take a look, okay?

96
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,710
So here's the brain of a non

97
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,430
-procrastinator.

98
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,410
Now, here's my brain.

99
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,770
There is a difference.

100
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,650
Both brains have a rational decision

101
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,490
-maker in them, but the procrastinator's

102
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,190
brain also has an instant gratification

103
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,030
monkey. Now, what does this mean for the

104
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,790
procrastinator? Well,

105
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,150
it means everything's fine until this

106
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,530
happens.

107
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,010
So the rational decision -maker will make

108
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,470
the rational decision to do something

109
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,390
productive, but the monkey doesn't like

110
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,930
that plan.

111
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,070
So he actually takes the wheel and he

112
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,030
says, actually, let's read the entire

113
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,830
Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerri and

114
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,350
Tanya Harding scandal because I just

115
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,350
remember that that happened.

116
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,310
Then...

117
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,690
Then we're going to go over to the fridge.

118
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,670
We're going to see if there's anything new

119
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,890
in there since 10 minutes ago.

120
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,550
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube

121
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,830
spiral that starts with videos of Richard

122
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,030
Feynman talking about magnets and ends

123
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,690
much, much later with us watching

124
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,570
interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.

125
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,350
All of that's going to take a while, so

126
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,610
we're not going to really have room on the

127
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,310
schedule for any work today, sorry.

128
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,250
Now, what is going on here?

129
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,470
The instant gratification monkey does not

130
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.

131
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,030
He lives entirely in the present moment.

132
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,970
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge

133
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,330
of the future, and he only cares about two

134
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,670
things,

135
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,450
easy and fun.

136
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,590
Now, in the animal world,

137
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,110
that works fine.

138
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,410
If you're a dog and you spend your whole

139
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,390
life doing nothing other than easy and fun

140
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,750
things, you're a huge success.

141
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,070
And to the monkey,

142
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,510
humans are just another animal. An animal

143
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,730
species has to keep well slept, well-fed,

144
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,650
and propagating into the next generation,

145
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,250
which in tribal times might have worked

146
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,190
okay. But if you haven't noticed, now

147
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,350
we're not in tribal times, we're in an

148
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,390
advanced civilization and the monkey does

149
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,570
not know what that is, which is why we

150
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,750
have another guy in our brain,

151
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,790
the rational decision maker,

152
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,450
who gives us the ability to do things no

153
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,250
other animal can do. We can visualize the

154
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,770
future, we can see the big picture,

155
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,210
we can make long -term plans, and he wants

156
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,830
to take all of that into account,

157
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,050
and he wants to just have us do whatever

158
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,450
makes sense to be doing right now.

159
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,650
Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing

160
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,730
things that are easy and fun, like when

161
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,410
you're having dinner or going to bed or

162
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,670
enjoying well-earned leisure time, that's

163
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,410
why there's an overlap.

164
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,870
Sometimes they agree.

165
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,030
But other times, it makes much more sense

166
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,210
to be doing things that are harder and

167
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,910
less pleasant for the sake of the big

168
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,490
picture, and that's when we have a

169
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,250
conflict. And for the procrastinator, that

170
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,170
conflict tends to end a certain way every

171
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,390
time, leaving him spending a lot of time

172
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,850
in this orange zone,

173
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,510
an easy and fun place that's entirely out

174
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,770
of the makes -sense circle. I call it the

175
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,550
dark playground.

176
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,150
LAUGHTER

177
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,150
Now,

178
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,990
the dark playground is a place that all of

179
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,750
you procrastinators out their know very

180
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,090
well.

181
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,710
It's where leisure activities happen at

182
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,450
times when leisure activities are not

183
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,210
supposed to be happening. The fun you have

184
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,770
in the dark playground isn't actually fun

185
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,890
because it's completely unearned

186
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,250
and the air is filled with guilt, dread,

187
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,550
anxiety, self-hatred, all those good

188
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,590
procrastinator feelings.

189
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,350
And the question is, in this situation,

190
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,270
with the monkey behind the wheel, how does

191
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,210
the procrastinator ever gets himself over

192
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,390
here to this blue zone,

193
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,490
a less pleasant place, but where really

194
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,430
important things happen?

195
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,390
Well,

196
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,250
it turns out that the procrastinator has a

197
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,930
guardian angel, someone who's always

198
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,030
looking down on him and watching over him,

199
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,710
in his darkest moments, someone called the

200
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,710
Panic Monster.

201
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,570
LAUGHTER

202
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,690
Now,

203
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,110
the Panic Monster is dormant most of the

204
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,610
time, but he suddenly wakes up.

205
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,410
Any time a deadline gets too close or

206
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,430
there's danger of public embarrassment, a

207
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,930
career disaster or some other scary

208
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,210
consequence. And importantly, he's the

209
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,350
only thing that the monkey is terrified

210
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,350
of. Now, he became very relevant in my

211
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,790
life pretty recently

212
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,970
because people of TED reached out to me

213
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,890
about six months ago and invited me to do

214
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,530
a TED talk.

215
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,650
LAUGHTER

216
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,870
Now, of course,

217
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,970
I said, yes, it's always been a dream of

218
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,530
mine to have done a TED talk in the past.

219
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,390
LAUGHTER

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,340
But in the middle of all this excitement,

221
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,820
the rational decision -makers seemed to

222
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,180
have something else in his mind. He was

223
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,400
saying,

224
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,520
are we clear on what we just accepted?

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,660
Do we get what's going to be now happening

226
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,080
one day in the future? We need to sit down

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,140
and work on this right now. And the monkey

228
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,920
said, totally agree, but also let's just

229
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,700
open Google Earth and let's zoom into the

230
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,440
bottom of India, like 200 feet above the

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,600
ground, and we're going to scroll up two

232
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,420
and a half hours until we get to the top

233
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,240
of the country so we can get a better feel

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,060
for India.

235
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,540
So that's what we did that day.

236
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,980
As six months turned into four, and then

237
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,260
two, and then one, the people of TED

238
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,980
decided to release the speakers. And I

239
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,720
opened up the website, and there was my

240
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,140
face staring right back at me, and guess

241
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,840
who woke up?

242
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,220
So the panic monster starts losing his

243
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,200
mind, and a few seconds later, the whole

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,180
system's in mayhem.

245
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,720
And the monkey, who remember, he's

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,500
terrified of the panic monster. Boom, he's

247
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,980
up the tree.

248
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,420
And finally,

249
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,360
finally,

250
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,220
the rational decision -maker can take the

251
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,660
wheel, and I can start working on the

252
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,460
talk. Now,

253
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,900
the panic monster explains all kinds of

254
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,120
pretty insane procrastinator behavior,

255
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,800
like how someone like me could spend two

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,020
weeks unable to start the opening sentence

257
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,740
of a paper and then miraculously find the

258
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,340
unbelievable work ethic to stay up all

259
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,800
night and write eight pages.

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,900
And this entire situation with the three

261
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,880
characters, this is the procrastinator's

262
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,260
system.

263
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,970
And it works.

264
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,210
And this is what I decided to write about

265
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,390
on the blog just a couple of years ago.

266
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,310
Now, when I did,

267
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,210
I was amazed by the response.

268
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,950
Literally thousands of emails came in from

269
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,510
all different kinds of people, from all

270
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,810
over the world, doing all different kinds

271
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,430
of things.

272
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,430
These were people who were nurses and

273
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,350
bankers and painters and engineers and

274
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,170
lots and lots of PhD students.

275
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,150
And they were all writing, saying the same

276
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,430
thing. I have this problem, too.

277
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,230
But what struck me was the contrast

278
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,970
between the light tone of the post

279
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,210
and the heaviness of these emails.

280
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,590
These people were writing with intense

281
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,750
frustration about what procrastination had

282
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,450
done to their lives, about what this

283
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,750
monkey had done to them.

284
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,210
And I thought about this, and I said, if

285
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,890
the procrastinator system works, then

286
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,770
what's going on? Why are all these people

287
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,850
in such a dark place? Well,

288
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,790
it turns out that there are two kinds of

289
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,530
procrastination.

290
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,170
Everything I've talked about today, the

291
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,250
examples I've given, they all have

292
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,510
deadlines. And when there's deadlines,

293
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,550
the effects of procrastination are

294
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,270
contained.

295
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,470
To the short term, because the panic

296
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,950
monster gets involved, but there's a

297
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,690
second kind of procrastination that

298
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,950
happens in situations when there is no

299
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,330
deadline.

300
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,090
So if you want to have a career where you

301
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,450
want to be a self-starter, something in

302
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,350
the arts, something entrepreneurial,

303
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,270
there's no deadlines on those things at

304
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,130
first, because nothing's happening at

305
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,690
first, not until you've gone out and done

306
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,430
the hard work to get some momentum to get

307
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,250
things going. There's also all kinds of

308
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,810
important things outside your career

309
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,610
that don't involve any deadlines, like

310
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,390
seeing your family or exercising and

311
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,450
taking care of your health,

312
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,050
working on your relationship or getting

313
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,590
out of a relationship that isn't working.

314
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,750
Now, if the procrastinator's only

315
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,350
mechanism

316
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,330
of doing these hard things is the panic

317
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,890
monster, that's a problem, because in all

318
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,610
of these non -deadline situations,

319
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,030
the panic monster doesn't show up, he has

320
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,050
nothing to wake up for, so the effects of

321
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,290
procrastination, they're not contained,

322
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,170
they just extend outward forever.

323
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,310
And it's this long -term kind of

324
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,070
procrastination

325
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,010
that's much less visible and much less

326
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,170
talked about than the funnier short -term

327
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,150
deadline -based kind. It's usually

328
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,170
suffered quietly and privately,

329
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,390
and it can be the source of a huge amount

330
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,990
of long -term unhappiness and regrets.

331
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,030
And I thought, you know, that's why these

332
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,070
people are emailing,

333
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,870
and that's why they're in such a bad

334
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,290
place.

335
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,470
It's not that they're cramming for some

336
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,790
project, it's that long -term

337
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,170
procrastination has made them feel like a

338
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,710
spectator at times in their own lives.

339
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,410
You know, the frustration was not that

340
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,590
they couldn't achieve their dreams, it's

341
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,090
that they weren't even able to start

342
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,010
chasing them.

343
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,910
So I read these emails, and I had a little

344
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,630
a bit of an epiphany,

345
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,530
that I don't think non -procrastinators

346
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,110
exist.

347
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,390
That's right,

348
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,730
I think all of you are procrastinators.

349
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,230
Now, you might not all be a mess,

350
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
like some of us,

351
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,270
and some of you may have a healthy

352
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,350
relationship with deadlines.

353
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,670
But remember, the monkey's sneakiest trick

354
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,210
is when the deadlines aren't there.

355
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,630
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

356
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,430
I call this a life calendar.

357
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,190
That's one box for every week.

358
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,390
Of a 90 -year life.

359
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,510
That's not that many boxes, especially

360
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,730
since we've already used a bunch of those.

361
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,390
So I think we need to all take a long,

362
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,350
hard look at that calendar.

363
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,370
And we need to think about what we're

364
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,870
really procrastinating on, because

365
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,530
everyone is procrastinating on something

366
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,190
in life.

367
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,310
We need to stay aware of the instant

368
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,410
gratification monkey.

369
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,570
That's a job for all of us.

370
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,330
And because there's not that many boxes on

371
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,610
there, it's a job that should probably

372
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,750
start today.

373
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,550
What?

374
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,490
Maybe not today,

375
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,210
but...

376
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,290
audience laughs

377
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,310
You know,

378
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,330
sometimes soon.

379
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,990
Thank you. Thank you.
