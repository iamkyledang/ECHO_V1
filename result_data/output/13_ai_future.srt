1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
In 1901,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,640
this ancient Greek artifact was discovered

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,320
in a shipwreck off the island of

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,100
Antikythera.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,180
3D x-ray scans have revealed it contains

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,780
37 interlocking bronze gears,

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,060
allowing it to model the motions of the

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,180
sun and moon,

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,080
and predict eclipses decades in advance.

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,500
Constructed around 100 or 200 BC,

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,300
the Antikythera mechanism represents a

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,140
sophisticated early computer, the likes of

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,880
which would not be seen again for at least

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,180
a thousand years.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,900
Now, of course, this computer didn't work

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,500
like modern digital computers.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,600
It works by analogy.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,360
The gears were constructed in such a way

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,780
that the motions of certain dials are

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,160
analogous to the motion of the sun and

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,460
moon.

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,420
It is an analog computer.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,820
Here is a simple analog computer for

24
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,040
adding two numbers together.

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,560
If you turn the black wheel some amount,

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,220
and then turn this white wheel a different

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,540
amount,

28
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,500
the gray wheel shows the sum of the two

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,160
rotations.

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,060
In contrast,

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,820
this is a digital mechanical computer

32
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,440
where you can add two single bit numbers.

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
So 0 plus 0 equals 0,

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,100
0 plus 1 equals 1,

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,040
and 1 plus 1 equals 2.

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,060
These two devices illustrate the

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,260
differences between analog and digital

38
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,820
computers.

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,920
Analog computers have a continuous range

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,400
of inputs and outputs,

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,160
whereas digital only works with discrete

42
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,860
values.

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,520
With analog computers, the quantities of

44
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,160
interest are actually represented by

45
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,420
something physical, like the amount a

46
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,540
wheel has turned,

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,380
whereas digital computers work on symbols

48
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,140
like 0s and 1s. If the answer is say 2,

49
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,660
there is nothing in the computer that is

50
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,500
twice as much as a 1.

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,980
In analog computers, there is.

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,400
For thousands of years, people used analog

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,880
devices like the anti -Kitara mechanism or

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,080
slide rules alongside digital devices like

55
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,280
abacuses, and up until the 1960s, the most

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,560
powerful computers on the planet were

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,620
actually analog.

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,560
Digital computers exploded onto the scene

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,240
with the advent of solid state

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,300
transistors, and now almost everything is

61
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,400
digital. Most people have never even heard

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
of analog computers.

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,340
But today,

64
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,120
that may all be changing.

65
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,700
Moore's law, the idea that you can double

66
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,460
the number of transistors on a chip every

67
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,080
two years,

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,200
it's reaching its limit because

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
transistors are nearly the same size as

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,820
atoms.

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,180
Simultaneously,

72
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,340
advancements in machine learning are

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,420
straining the capabilities of digital

74
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,960
computers.

75
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
The solution to these challenges may well

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
be a new generation of analog computers.

77
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,480
One of the most important problems humans

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
have faced for millennia is predicting the

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,600
tides.

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,400
Napoleon and his men nearly died crossing

81
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,080
the Red Sea due to a miscalculation of the

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,820
rising tide,

83
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,100
and sailors routinely needed to know the

84
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,900
tides to bring their ships into port

85
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,960
without running a ground.

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,320
Most coastal locations on earth experience

87
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,020
too high and too low tides per day,

88
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,180
but their exact timing varies as does

89
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,840
their magnitude,

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,640
and this is partly caused by local factors

91
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,940
like the depth of the seabed and the shape

92
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,800
of the shoreline.

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,820
In the late 1700s, to describe the tidal

94
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,660
flow of the oceans,

95
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,220
Pierre Kimono Labs derived a set of

96
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,940
complicated differential equations.

97
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,580
They had no analytical solution, so at the

98
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,200
time they were basically useless.

99
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,820
But in the process of deriving his

100
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,220
equations, Laplace made a key finding.

101
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,420
Tides are driven at only a few specifics

102
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,960
astronomical frequencies,

103
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
including the moon,

104
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,040
the sun,

105
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,940
and the eccentricity of the lunar orbit.

106
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,060
Each one of these factors contributes a

107
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,580
sine wave of a particular amplitude and

108
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,000
phase to the total tide curve.

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,060
If someone could figure out how to

110
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,680
correctly combine this frequency

111
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,240
components,

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,020
well the tides could finally be predicted.

113
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,060
It took nearly a century, but in the 1860s

114
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,340
William Thompson, later Lord Kelvin,

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
took up the challenge.

116
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,360
Having completed several voyages to lay

117
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,480
the first transatlantic telegraph cable,

118
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,920
he developed a fascination with the sea,

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
and subsequently he threw his full

120
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,560
scientific effort into measuring and

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,740
predicting the tides.

122
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,160
Tide gauges at the time used a buoy to

123
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,300
record the height of the sea onto a paper

124
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,760
roll.

125
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,840
Kelvin set out to determine how sine waves

126
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,820
with the frequencies identified by Laplace

127
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,680
could add together to produce the observed

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,560
tidal curve.

129
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,620
The key was to apply the work of French

130
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,140
mathematician Joseph Fourier,

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,320
who had shown how to decompose any

132
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,660
function into a sum of sine waves.

133
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,440
Most English scientists were skeptical of

134
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,080
the work, but Thompson was enthralled by

135
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,520
it. His first paper, published at 17,

136
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
was a defense of Fourier.

137
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,420
While it was straightforward to apply

138
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,200
Fourier's analysis to tidal curves,

139
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,980
the computation required was enormous.

140
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,760
First, divide the tide curve up into short

141
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
time intervals,

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,380
and for each interval, multiply the tide

143
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,000
level by a sine wave with the frequency of

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,400
interest.

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,360
Add up the area of all these rectangles

146
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
and divide by the total time,

147
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,400
and this gives you a single coefficient,

148
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,280
the amplitude of the sine wave with this

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,800
frequency.

150
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,540
Then you have to repeat the process for a

151
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,760
cosine function with the same frequency.

152
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,820
Kelvin found that to make accurate

153
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,240
predictions,

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,960
he actually needed 10 different frequency

155
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,440
components,

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,440
so that is a lot of multiplication and

157
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,820
addition to characterize the tides at just

158
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
one location.

159
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,960
For each additional location,

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,760
you have to perform this analysis all over

161
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,240
again.

162
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
And this is only half the problem.

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,040
Once you have the amplitudes and phases of

164
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,700
the sine functions,

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,100
you have to add them up to predict future

166
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,560
tides.

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,360
Lord Kelvin spent years analyzing and

168
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,960
predicting tides by hand.

169
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,340
Then he had a stroke of inspiration.

170
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,860
Could you design a machine to carry out

171
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,240
these calculations automatically?

172
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,460
In Kelvin's words to substitute brass for

173
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,900
brains,

174
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,880
the resulting analog computers were in use

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,280
for nearly a century.

176
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,640
They even played a critical role in the

177
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,320
outcome of World War II.

178
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,480
Kelvin started with the problem of

179
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,900
prediction,

180
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,480
adding the sine waves together, given you

181
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,060
know their amplitudes and phases.

182
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,440
He knew he could create sinusoidal motion

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
with a device called a Scotch yoke.

184
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,180
It extracts one dimension from uniform

185
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
circular motion.

186
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
But to make a tide prediction, he needed a

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,260
way to combine 10 sine waves together.

188
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,020
He needed a mechanical analog for

189
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,560
addition.

190
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,700
Stuck on this problem in 1872,

191
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,920
Kelvin boarded a train for a meeting with

192
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,620
the main sponsor of his title research,

193
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
the British Association.

194
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,000
On the train, Kelvin bumped into a friend,

195
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,640
inventor Beauchamp Tower,

196
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,820
to whom he explained his dilemma.

197
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Tower suggested he use Wheatstone's plan

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
of a chain passing round a number of

199
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,260
pulleys.

200
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,700
And this was exactly the addition

201
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,420
mechanism Kelvin was looking for.

202
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,560
By attaching a pulley to each Scotch yoke

203
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
and running a weighted cord around them,

204
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
he could mechanically add all of their

205
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,260
contributions at once.

206
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,880
He scribbled down the entire plan for this

207
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
predictor machine by the end of the train

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,000
ride.

209
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,380
He pitched it to the British Association

210
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,060
and secured funding to build it all before

211
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,100
he returned home.

212
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,020
If you knew the relative contributions of

213
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,220
different frequency components,

214
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,340
Kelvin now had a machine to automate the

215
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,880
tedious task of predicting future tides.

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,760
This was a great leap forward.

217
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Four hours of cranking the handle yielded

218
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,040
a full year of tidal predictions.

219
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,120
But for many years, the harder half of the

220
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
problem was still done by hand,

221
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,640
breaking apart an existing tide curve into

222
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,900
its component frequencies.

223
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,760
To automate this step, Kelvin needed a

224
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,000
machine capable of multiplying the tide

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,820
curve times a sine wave and then taking

226
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,500
its integral.

227
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,640
What would such a device even look like?

228
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,620
With his older brother James Thompson,

229
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,240
Kelvin came up with a mechanical

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,080
integrator.

231
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,240
It consists of a ball on a rotating disc.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Due to the rotation of the disc, the

233
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,640
further the ball is from the center,

234
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,180
the faster it spins.

235
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,000
If the ball is at the very center of the

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,740
disc, it doesn't turn at all.

237
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,500
And if it's on the left side, it turns in

238
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,540
the opposite direction.

239
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,400
Now the motion of the ball is converted

240
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,720
into an output via a roller, which moves a

241
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,220
pen up or down on the output graph paper.

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,100
So the way it works is you trace the

243
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,500
function you want to integrate with a

244
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,000
stylus.

245
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,480
And the stylus controls the position of

246
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,880
the ball on the disc, and hence its speed

247
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,560
of rotation.

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,640
This is transferred through the roller to

249
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,060
the output, which plots the integral of

250
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,000
the original function.

251
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,900
Now to decompose a tide curve, we don't

252
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,220
just want to integrate the function,

253
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,780
we first want to multiply it by a sine

254
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,420
wave of a particular frequency.

255
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,480
And the way to do this is to make the disc

256
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
rotate back and forth at that specific

257
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,740
frequency.

258
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,220
Now the rotation of the ball depends on not

259
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,740
only on where it is on the disc, but also

260
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
on how the disc is turning at that

261
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,120
instant.

262
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,020
You trace the tide curve with the stylus,

263
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,500
which moves the ball back and forth on the

264
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,180
oscillating disc, and the roller sums up

265
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,600
the integral of the tide curve times the

266
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,160
sine wave.

267
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,240
Simply divide by the total time to get the

268
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,700
coefficient.

269
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,800
Several of these ball and disc integrators

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,120
can be connected in parallel,

271
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,040
with each disc oscillating at a different

272
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,580
frequency,

273
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,280
to calculate the coefficients for multiple

274
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,700
frequency components at the same time.

275
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,320
Kelvin's analog computers revolutionized

276
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,940
our ability to predict tides.

277
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,460
Tidal curves from anywhere in the world

278
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,640
could be turned into a set of sinusoidal

279
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,840
coefficients using the ball and disc

280
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,040
harmonic analyzer,

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,580
and the resulting sinusoids could be added

282
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,260
together to predict future tides using his

283
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,940
Scotch -Yoke pulley machine.

284
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,880
Kelvin's harmonic analyzers were the basis

285
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,260
for a landmark analog computer called the

286
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,640
Differential Analyzer, and his tide

287
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,820
predicting machines were used well into

288
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,920
the 1960s.

289
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,280
In fact, they were later overhauled to

290
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,320
include 26 frequency components and used

291
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,000
to plan the Allied invasion on D-Day.

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,760
The Germans expected any invasion to come

293
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
at high tide to minimize the time Allied

294
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,840
soldiers would be exposed on the beaches,

295
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,620
so they installed millions of obstacles

296
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,740
that would be underwater by mid-tide,

297
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,320
many with explosive mines attached.

298
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,460
But the Allies spotted the obstacles and

299
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,020
changed tack. Instead, they planned to

300
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
begin the invasion at low tide.

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
This would allow demolition teams to first

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
clear channels through the obstacles.

303
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,280
Then the main forces could come through

304
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,020
those gaps as the water rose.

305
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,220
This would also give landing craft enough

306
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,420
time to depart without getting beached.

307
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,080
The low water times were different at the

308
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,860
five landing beaches by over an hour, so

309
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,820
the invasion times were staggered

310
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,500
according to the tide predictions.

311
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,580
This wasn't the only use of analog

312
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,920
computers in World War II.

313
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,820
Dive bomber aircraft would plummet out of

314
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
the sky directly toward their targets at

315
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,740
up to an 80-degree angle, and their rapid

316
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,060
descents made them very difficult to shoot

317
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,400
down.

318
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,300
So the US began searching for devices to

319
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
automatically aim guns at dive bombers.

320
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Most of the proposed solutions fell into

321
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,740
one of two categories.

322
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,460
Some were analog machines like Lord

323
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,040
Kelvin's, others were essentially fast

324
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,780
calculators.

325
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,180
Mechanical calculating machines like the

326
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,260
Abacus had been around for millennia, but

327
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,580
they were far too slow to respond to dive

328
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,920
bombers. These new calculating machines

329
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,420
sped things up by using electrical pulses.

330
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
The committee considered naming these

331
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
devices after the pulses they used, but

332
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
member George Kibitz proposed a more

333
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,440
general name,

334
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,200
digital,

335
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,080
because these machines operated on numbers

336
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,640
themselves,

337
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,680
or digits.

338
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,300
And this is the origin of the term digital

339
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,900
computer.

340
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,220
But digital would have to wait. Of all the

341
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
proposals, an innovative analog machine

342
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,900
from David Parkinson went out.

343
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,860
At Bell Labs in New York, Parkinson had

344
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,460
been working on a device to chart

345
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,100
telephone data called an automatic level

346
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,640
recorder.

347
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,100
It used a variable resistor called a

348
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,360
potentiometer to control the motion of a

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,560
pen.

350
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,560
One night, after hearing reports of the

351
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,520
harrowing Allied evacuation of Dunkirk,

352
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,280
Parkinson had a dream that he was on the

353
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,940
front lines.

354
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,920
I found myself in a gun pit with an anti

355
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,940
-aircraft gun crew.

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,900
A gun there was firing occasionally, and

357
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,340
the impressive thing was that every shot

358
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,540
brought down an airplane.

359
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,200
After three or four shots, one of the men

360
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,220
in the crew smiled at me and beckoned me

361
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,320
to come closer to the gun.

362
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,640
When I drew near, he pointed to the

363
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,420
exposed end of the left trunnion.

364
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,840
Mounted there was the control

365
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,260
potentiometer of my level recorder.

366
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,600
When he woke up, Parkinson realized the

367
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
device he was building to control a pen

368
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,060
could be scaled up to control an anti

369
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,000
-aircraft gun.

370
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
He shared this idea with his supervisor,

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,380
and after receiving approval from the

372
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:35,800
military,

373
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,580
they set out to make Parkinson's dream a

374
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,000
reality.

375
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,800
Researchers at Bell Labs had recently

376
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,100
invented an analog electrical device

377
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,480
called an operational amplifier or op

378
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,640
-amp.

379
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,060
It could perform mathematical operations

380
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,900
with voltages like addition and

381
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,180
multiplication.

382
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,360
They used these op -amps to create an

383
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,100
analog computer that could solve the

384
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,920
ballistics equations for anti-aircraft

385
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,320
guns.

386
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,200
Using radar and optical sights to obtain

387
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,360
the speed, altitude, and direction of

388
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,980
enemy planes,

389
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,080
the M9 gun director, as the computer was

390
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,400
called,

391
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,620
could rapidly calculate the correct

392
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,240
trajectory and fuse setting.

393
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,120
Potentiometers were used to ascertain the

394
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,520
direction the gun was pointing.

395
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,800
This was not the first electric analog

396
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,200
computer, but it was an important one.

397
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,540
In World War I, it took an average of 17

398
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,700
, 000 rounds to take down a single

399
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,180
airplane.

400
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,660
In 1943, after the invention of the M9, it

401
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,160
took an average of only 90.

402
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,060
During the war, the US invested big in

403
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,880
analog computers.

404
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,080
If you break down their total military

405
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,660
budget, the third-largest single expense

406
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,860
was the development and production of an

407
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,080
incredibly complex mechanical analog

408
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,420
computer called the Borden bomb site.

409
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,640
Unfortunately,

410
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,720
they didn't get their money's worth.

411
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,480
Designed by the eccentric Dutch engineer

412
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,060
Carlo Nordio, the Borden bomb site was built

413
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,480
to enable high precision airborne bombing.

414
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,580
It implemented 64 different simultaneous

415
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,360
algorithms,

416
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,680
including one that compensated for the

417
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,780
rotation of the earth as the bomb fell.

418
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,300
The Borden was one of the most closely

419
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,780
guarded secrets of the war.

420
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,200
To prevent the technology from falling

421
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,120
into enemy hands,

422
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,220
American bombardiers carried handguns

423
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,780
specifically to destroy it in the event of

424
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,180
a crash.

425
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,240
But despite its hype and funding,

426
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,540
the Borden didn't work as advertised.

427
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,220
With over 2, 000 fine parts,

428
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,780
it required extreme precision to

429
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,180
manufacture.

430
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,520
The problem with analog computers is that

431
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,440
the physical device is a model for the

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,080
real world, so any inaccuracy in the

433
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,920
components translates into inaccuracy of

434
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,620
the computation.

435
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,460
And since there will always be some slop

436
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,980
in the connections between parts,

437
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
if you run the same calculation twice,

438
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
you won't get the exact same answer.

439
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,940
In the American campaign against Japan,

440
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,300
bomber crews using the bomb site were

441
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,720
unable to destroy critical Japanese war

442
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,260
infrastructure.

443
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,560
And ultimately,

444
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,180
the US abandoned its precision bombing

445
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,540
approach and instead blanketed whole

446
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
Japanese cities in napalm.

447
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,800
As the war progressed, digital computers

448
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,700
gained traction.

449
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,560
The digital and electronic colossus

450
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,020
machines of Bletchley Park in the UK were

451
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,840
critical to breaking German codes.

452
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,080
In the United States, the military

453
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,240
invested in an enormously complex and

454
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,680
expensive digital machine known as ENIAC.

455
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,020
It was designed to speed up the

456
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,160
calculation of land artillery firing

457
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,640
tables.

458
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,860
At the time, these were computed using

459
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,360
differential analyzers, the analog

460
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,700
mechanical computers based on Kelvin's

461
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
harmonic analyzer.

462
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,440
Although not finished until after the war,

463
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,300
ENIAC demonstrated the power of digital

464
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,880
computers.

465
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,340
It's considered by many to be the first

466
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,640
modern computer.

467
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,580
What really opened the door to this

468
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,560
digital revolution was the discovery made

469
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,200
by Claude Shannon in his 1936 master's

470
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,480
thesis.

471
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,600
He showed that any numerical operation can

472
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
be carried out using the basic building

473
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,780
blocks of Boolean algebra.

474
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Two values, true or false, also notated as

475
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,320
one or zero,

476
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,100
and three operations,

477
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,040
and or and not.

478
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,080
This makes digital computers the ideal

479
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,680
versatile computing machines.

480
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,760
In contrast, each analog computer is an

481
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,340
analog for only one type of problem.

482
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,660
Furthermore, since digital computers

483
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,020
operate on ones and zeros,

484
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,200
they are more resilient in the face of

485
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,480
noise.

486
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,300
It would take a large error to mistake a

487
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,160
one for a zero or vice versa,

488
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,720
whereas even small errors in analog

489
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,380
computers can grow and ultimately swamp

490
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,060
the signal.

491
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,960
So these days, everything is digital. Our

492
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
phones, computers,

493
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,940
and internet data centers, even TV and

494
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,100
radio is now being broadcast as digital.

495
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,120
And the advantages are obvious.

496
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,760
Since digital devices operate on symbols,

497
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,280
usually zeros and ones,

498
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,380
they provide exact answers.

499
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,160
And repeat the calculation and you get the

500
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,820
same result.

501
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,100
They are robust to noise.

502
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,860
Plus, since only a few components are

503
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,300
required to perform virtually any

504
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,900
computation,

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,580
those components have been miniaturized

506
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,380
and optimized,

507
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,000
making digital computers the ideal

508
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,700
universal computing machines.

509
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,000
So you would think analog computers would

510
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,580
be long gone, a relic of the distant past,

511
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,000
but analog may now be making a comeback.

512
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,240
There are startups actively working on

513
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,320
analog computers.

514
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,140
Why is this happening? What could be the

515
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,360
benefit of analog?

516
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,560
I wanted to put all of this into one

517
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:40,920
video,

518
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,040
but the story is too good to bury 20

519
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,820
minutes in. So that is coming up in part

520
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,740
two. Be sure you're subscribed to the

521
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,660
channel to be notified when that comes

522
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:50,940
out.

523
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,960
I'll give you a hint about the sequel in

524
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
this section of the video, which is

525
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,580
sponsored by Brilliant.

526
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,180
Brilliant is a website and app that uses

527
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,440
interactivity to help you learn STEM

528
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,300
concepts. For the sequel to this video, it

529
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,440
would be a good idea to brush up on

530
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,580
artificial intelligence, which you can do

531
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,440
with Brilliant's courses on neural

532
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,880
networks.

533
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
Here you can analyze how a neural network

534
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
decodes your handwriting.

535
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,380
I also recommend their calculus courses,

536
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,880
which are highly interactive.

537
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,420
What's great about Brilliant is how it

538
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,240
gets you to step through topics, answering

539
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,260
questions as you go,

540
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,340
and that way you can't trick yourself into

541
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,680
thinking you already understand

542
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,180
everything, because you're constantly

543
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,840
putting your knowledge to the test.

544
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
Personally, I find their courses

545
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,400
challenging, which they should be in order

546
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,500
for you to learn anything.

547
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,720
But if you ever get stuck, there's always

548
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,820
a helpful hint close at hand, and more in

549
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,580
-depth explanations are available if you

550
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,020
want them.

551
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,520
As the holiday season is upon us, an
