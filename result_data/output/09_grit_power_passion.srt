1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,900
The human voice, it's the instrument we

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,380
all play.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,040
It's the most powerful sound in the world,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,540
probably it's the only one that can start

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,260
a war or say, I love you.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,460
And yet many people have the experience

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,320
that when they speak, people don't listen

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,720
to them.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,700
Why is that? How can we speak powerfully

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,940
to make change in the world?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,260
What I'd like to suggest there are a

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,860
number of habits that we need to move away

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,240
from. I've assembled for your pleasure

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,040
here seven deadly sins of speaking.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,220
I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,800
list, but these seven I think are pretty

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,220
large.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,660
Habits that we can all fall into.

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,500
First,

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,920
gossip,

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,500
speaking ill of somebody who's not

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,840
present.

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,340
Not a nice habit and we know perfectly

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,180
well the person gossiping five minutes

25
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,560
later will be gossiping about us.

26
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,760
Second, judging.

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,160
We know people who are like this in

28
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,780
conversation and it's very hard to listen

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,020
to somebody if you know that you're being

30
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,460
judged and found wanting at the same time.

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,380
Third, negativity.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,440
You can fall into this. My mother in the

33
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,140
last years of her life became very, very

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,600
negative and it's hard to listen. I

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,900
remember one day I said to her,

36
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,980
it's October the first today and she said,

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,100
I know, isn't it dreadful?

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,940
It's hard to listen when somebody's that

39
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,400
negative.

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,260
And another form of negativity,

41
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:32,980
complaining.

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,780
Well, this is the national art of the UK.

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,400
It's our national sport. We complain about

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,160
the weather, about sport, about politics,

45
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,720
about everything.

46
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,980
But actually complaining is viral misery.

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,540
It's not spreading sunshine and lightness

48
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,060
in the world.

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Excuses.

50
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,240
We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,360
been this guy. Some people have a blame

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,820
-thrower.

53
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
They just pass it on to everybody else and

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,220
don't take responsibility for their

55
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,720
actions. And again, hard to listen to

56
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
somebody who's being like that.

57
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

58
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,200
embroidery,

59
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,260
exaggeration.

60
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,880
It demeans our language actually

61
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,240
sometimes.

62
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,220
For example, if I see something that

63
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,360
really is awesome,

64
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
what do I call it?

65
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,500
And then of course this exaggeration

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,540
becomes lying, out-and-out lying and we

67
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,860
don't want to listen to people we know are

68
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,500
lying to us.

69
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,920
And finally,

70
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,340
dogmatism.

71
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,500
The confusion of facts with opinions.

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,920
When those two things get conflated,

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
you're listening into the wind. You know,

74
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,280
somebody is bombarding you with their

75
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,540
opinions. As if they were true,

76
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
it's difficult to listen to that.

77
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,260
So here they are,

78
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,160
seven deadly sins of speaking. These are

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
things I think we need to avoid.

80
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
But is there a positive way to think about

81
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,560
this?

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
Yes, there is.

83
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,420
I'd like to suggest that there are four

84
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,160
really powerful cornerstones, foundations,

85
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,180
that we can stand on if we want our speech

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,920
to be powerful and to make change in the

87
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,240
world.

88
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,040
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

89
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,220
The word is hail and it has a great

90
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,320
definition as well. I'm not talking about

91
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
the stuff that falls from the sky and hits

92
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,500
you on the head.

93
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,580
I'm talking about this definition, too

94
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,200
greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which

95
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,860
does I think how our words will be received

96
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,000
if we stand on these four things. So what

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,700
do they stand for?

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
See if you can guess.

99
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,880
The H,

100
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,440
honesty, of course.

101
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,300
Being true in what you say, being straight

102
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,760
and clear.

103
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,780
The A is authenticity,

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,860
just being yourself.

105
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,220
A friend of mine described it as standing

106
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,100
in your own truth, which I think is a

107
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,940
lovely way to put it.

108
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,760
The is integrity,

109
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,320
being your word, actually doing what you

110
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,340
say and being somebody people can trust.

111
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,140
And the L is love.

112
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
I don't mean romantic love,

113
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
but I do mean wishing people well.

114
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,640
For two reasons. First, I think

115
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,900
absolute honesty may not be what we want.

116
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,400
I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this

117
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,680
morning.

118
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,000
Perhaps that's not necessary.

119
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,460
Tempered with love, of course, honesty is

120
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,120
a great thing. But also, if you're really

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,240
wishing somebody well,

122
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,420
it's very hard to judge them at the same

123
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,760
time.

124
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,920
I'm not even sure you can do those two

125
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,260
things simultaneously.

126
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,980
So Hale.

127
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,980
Also, now that's what you say, and it's

128
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,480
like the old song, it is what you say,

129
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,140
it's also the way that you say it.

130
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,580
You have an amazing toolbox. This

131
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,720
instrument is incredible.

132
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,060
And yet this is a toolbox that very few

133
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,080
people have ever opened.

134
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,180
I'd like to have a little rummage in there

135
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,760
with you now. And just pull a few tools

136
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,340
out that you might like to take away and

137
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,440
play with, which will increase the power

138
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,960
of your speaking.

139
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,340
Register, for example.

140
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,320
Now, falsetto register may not be very

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,020
useful most of the time. But there's a

142
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,940
register in between.

143
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,540
I'm not going to get very technical about

144
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,900
this for any of you who are voice coaches.

145
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,960
You can locate your voice, however.

146
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,260
So if I talk up here in my nose, you can

147
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,780
hear the difference if I go down here in

148
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,920
my throat, which is where most of us speak

149
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,140
from most of the time.

150
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,260
But if you want weight,

151
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,600
you need to go down here to the chest.

152
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,720
You hear the difference?

153
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
We vote for politicians with lower voices.

154
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,040
It's true, because we associate depth with

155
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,180
power and with authority.

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
That's register.

157
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,980
And we have timbre.

158
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,920
It's the way your voice feels.

159
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,940
Again, the research shows that we prefer

160
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,060
voices which are rich,

161
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,920
smooth,

162
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,900
warm,

163
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,420
like hot chocolate.

164
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,140
Well, if that's not you, that's not the

165
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,940
end of the world. Because you can train.

166
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,260
Go get a voice coach.

167
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,240
And there are amazing things you can do

168
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,320
with breathing, with posture,

169
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,860
and with exercises to improve the timbre

170
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,680
of your voice.

171
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,860
Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the

172
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,040
sing-song, the meta -language that we use

173
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,320
in order to impart meaning. It's Route 1

174
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,740
for meaning in conversation.

175
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,800
People who speak all on one note are

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,020
really quite hard to listen to if they

177
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,440
don't have any prosody at all.

178
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,400
That's where the word monotonic comes

179
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,220
from, or monotonous, monotone.

180
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,600
Also, we have repetitive prosody now

181
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,060
coming in, where every sentence ends as if

182
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,080
it were a question, when it's actually not

183
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
a question, it's a statement.

184
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,000
And if you repeat that one over and over,

185
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,980
it's actually restricting your ability to

186
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,780
communicate through prosody, which I think

187
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,460
is a shame.

188
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
So let's try and break that habit.

189
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,140
Pace. I can get very, very excited by

190
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,180
saying something really, really quickly,

191
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,800
or I can slow right down to emphasize.

192
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,320
And at the end of that, of course, is our

193
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
old friend silence.

194
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,820
It's nothing wrong with a bit of silence

195
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,400
in a talk, is there?

196
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,980
We don't have to fill it with UMS and RS.

197
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,680
It can be very powerful.

198
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,900
Of course, pitch often goes along with

199
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,520
pace to indicate a arousal, but you can do

200
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,220
it just with pitch.

201
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,740
Where did you leave my keys?

202
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,600
Where did you leave my keys?

203
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,780
It's a slightly different meaning in those

204
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,340
two deliveries.

205
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,440
And finally, volume.

206
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
I can get really excited

207
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
by using volume, sorry about that, if I

208
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,320
startled anybody,

209
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,460
or I can have you really pay attention by

210
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,380
getting very quiet.

211
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Some people broadcast the whole time, try

212
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,400
not to do that. That's called podcasting.

213
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,840
Imposing your sound on people around you

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,460
carelessly and inconsiderately, not nice.

215
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,180
Of course, where this all comes into play,

216
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,000
most of all, is when you've got something

217
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
really important to do. It might be

218
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,280
standing on a stage like this and giving a

219
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,040
talk to people. It might be proposing

220
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,420
marriage,

221
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,640
asking for a raise,

222
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,520
a wedding speech, whatever it is.

223
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,580
If it's really important, you owe it to

224
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,800
yourself to look at this toolbox and the

225
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
engine that it's going to work on, and no

226
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
engine works well without being warmed up,

227
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,540
warm up your voice.

228
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Actually,

229
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,680
let me show you how to do that. Would you

230
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,580
all like to stand up for a moment?

231
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm going to show you the six vocal warm

232
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,520
-up exercises that I do before every talk

233
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
I ever do.

234
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Any time you're going to talk to anybody

235
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
important, do these. First, arms up.

236
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,920
Deep breath in and sigh out like that. One

237
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,340
more time.

238
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,780
Very good.

239
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,300
Now we're going to warm up our lips, and

240
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,080
we're going to go bop, bop, bop,

241
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,020
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. Very good.

242
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,240
And now...

243
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,900
Just like when you were a kid.

244
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,660
Now your lips should be coming alive.

245
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,640
We're going to do the tongue next with

246
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,720
exaggerated la, la, la.

247
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,990
La, la, la, la. Beautiful! You're getting

248
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,710
really good at this, and then roll an R.

249
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,670
That's like champagne for the tongue.

250
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,230
Finally, and if I can only do one,

251
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,470
the prose called this the siren, it's

252
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,770
really good. It starts with we and goes to

253
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,550
or. The are high, the or is low. So we

254
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,250
go whee!

255
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,450
Fantastic!

256
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,110
Give yourselves a round of applause. Thank

257
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,210
you.

258
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,080
Next time you speak do those in advance.

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Now let me just put this in context to

260
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,580
close.

261
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,880
This is a serious point here.

262
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,640
This is where we are now, right? We speak

263
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
not very well into people who simply

264
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
aren't listening in an environment that's

265
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,500
all about noise and bad acoustics. I have

266
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
talked about that on this stage in

267
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,520
different phases.

268
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,160
What would the world be like if we were

269
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,080
speaking powerfully to people who are

270
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,160
listening consciously in environments

271
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,020
which were actually fit for purpose or to

272
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
make that a bit larger?

273
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,160
What would the world be like if we were

274
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,880
creating sound consciously and consuming

275
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,180
sound consciously and designing all our

276
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,740
environments consciously for sound? That

277
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,840
would be a world that does sound beautiful

278
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,400
and one where understanding would be the

279
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,640
norm and that is an idea worth spreading.

280
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,780
Thank you.

281
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,720
You
