1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,760
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,360
my TEDx Houston talk.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,000
I woke up the morning after I gave that

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,860
talk with the worst vulnerability hangover

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,580
of my life.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,660
And I actually didn't leave my house for

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,580
about three days.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,460
The first time I left was to meet a friend

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,360
for lunch.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,840
And when I walked in, she was already at

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,360
the table and I sat down and she said,

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,640
God, you look like hell.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,400
I said, thanks,

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,200
I feel really,

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm not functioning. And she said, what's

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,760
going on? And I said, I just told 500

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,400
people that I became a researcher to avoid

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,940
vulnerability

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,160
and that when being vulnerable emerged

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,700
from my data as absolutely essential to a

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,520
wholehearted living,

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,500
I told these 500 people that I had a

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,780
breakdown.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,140
I had a slide that said breakdown. At what

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,280
point did I think that was a good idea?

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,100
And she said, I saw your talk live

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,740
streamed. It was not really you, it was a

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,080
little different from what you usually do,

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,900
but it was great.

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,960
And I said,

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,960
this can't happen,

32
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,280
YouTube, they're putting this thing on

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,000
YouTube and we're going to be talking

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,080
about 600,

35
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,520
700 people.

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,940
And she said, well,

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,480
I think it's too late. And I said,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,920
let me ask you something.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,720
She said, yeah. And I said,

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
do you remember when we were in college

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,640
and really wild and kind of dumb?

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,620
She said, yeah. And I said, remember when

43
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,680
we leave a terrible message on our ex

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,880
-boyfriend's answering machine?

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,020
and then erase the tape.

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
And she goes,

48
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,600
no.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,700
So, of course, the only thing I could

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,220
think of to say at that point was, yeah,

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,600
me neither.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,640
Yeah, me neither.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
And I'm thinking to myself,

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,140
Brent, what are you doing? What are you

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,900
doing? Why did you bring this up?

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,640
Have you lost your mind?

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,000
Your sisters would be perfect for this.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
So I look back up and she said,

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,740
are you really going to try to break in

60
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,500
and steal the video before they put it on

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,780
YouTube?

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,400
And I said,

63
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm just thinking about it a little bit.

64
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,320
She said,

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,020
you're like the worst vulnerability role

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,840
model ever.

67
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,520
And then I looked at her and I said

68
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,100
something that at the time felt a little

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,140
dramatic but ended up being more prophetic

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,320
than dramatic. I said,

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,040
if 500 turns into 1, 000 or 2, 000,

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,900
my life is over.

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,020
I had no contingency plan for four

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,300
a million.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,340
And my life did end when that happened.

76
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,140
And maybe the hardest part about my life

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,540
ending is that I learned something hard

78
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,340
about myself and that was that as much as

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,900
I would be frustrated about not being able

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,020
to get my work out to the world, there was

81
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,460
a part of me that was working very hard to

82
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
engineer staying small,

83
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,200
staying right under the radar.

84
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
But I want to talk about what I've

85
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,920
learned. There are two things that I've

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
learned in the last year.

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,080
The first is vulnerability is not

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,660
weakness.

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,340
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.

90
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,900
Let me ask you honestly,

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,140
and I'll give you this warning. I'm

92
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,160
trained as a therapist, so I can outweigh

93
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,620
you uncomfortably.

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,140
So if you could just raise your hand, that

95
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,620
would be awesome.

96
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,380
How many of you honestly, when you're

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,980
thinking about doing something vulnerable

98
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,300
or saying something vulnerable,

99
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,220
thank God, vulnerability is weakness. This

100
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,500
is weakness. How many of you think of

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,140
vulnerability and weakness synonymously?

102
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,680
The majority of people.

103
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,240
Now let me ask you this question. This

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,540
past week at TED,

105
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,380
how many of you when you saw vulnerability

106
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,600
up here thought it was pure courage?

107
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
Vulnerability is not weakness.

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,640
I define vulnerability as emotional risk,

109
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,160
exposure,

110
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,360
uncertainty.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,380
It fuels our daily lives.

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,520
And I've come to the belief, this is my

113
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
12th year doing this research,

114
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,080
that vulnerability is our most accurate

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,440
measurement of courage.

116
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,360
To be vulnerable, to let ourselves be

117
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,440
seen, to be honest.

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
One of the weird things that's happened is

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,500
after the TED explosion, I got a lot of

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
offers to speak all over the country.

121
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,420
Everyone from schools and parent meetings

122
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,180
to Fortune 500 companies,

123
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,840
and so many of the calls went like this,

124
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,600
hey Dr. Brown, we love your TED talk, we'd

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
like you to come in and speak.

126
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,120
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention

127
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,300
vulnerability or shame.

128
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,600
What would you like for me to talk about?

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
There are three big answers.

130
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,660
This is mostly, to be honest with you,

131
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,500
from the business sector.

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,480
Innovation,

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,420
creativity,

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,920
and change.

135
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,480
So let me go on the record and say,

136
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,920
vulnerability is the birthplace of

137
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,420
innovation,

138
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,360
creativity,

139
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,600
and change.

140
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,800
to create is to make something that has

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
never existed before.

142
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,260
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,300
Adaptability to change is all about

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,820
vulnerability.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,900
The second thing, in addition to really

146
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,360
finally understanding the relationship

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,820
between vulnerability and courage, the

148
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,520
second thing I learned is this.

149
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,800
We have to talk about shame.

150
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,100
And I'm going to be really honest with

151
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,700
you. When I became a vulnerability

152
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,620
researcher,

153
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,140
and that became the focus because of the

154
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,640
TED talk, and I'm not kidding that.

155
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,140
I'll give you an example. About three

156
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,620
months ago, I was in a sporting good

157
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,820
store, buying goggles and shin guards and

158
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,760
all the things that parents buy at the

159
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,440
sporting goods store.

160
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,700
About from 100 feet away, this is what I

161
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:04,960
hear.

162
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,460
Vulnerability TED, vulnerability TED.

163
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,620
I'm a fifth generation Texan.

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,100
Our family motto is lock and load.

165
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,900
vulnerability researcher.

166
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,360
So I'm like,

167
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,860
just keep walking, she's on my six.

168
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,280
And then I hear, vulnerability Ted!

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,860
I turn around, I go,

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,820
hi,

171
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,660
she's right here. And she said,

172
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,820
you're the shame researcher who had the

173
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,180
breakdown.

174
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,820
At this point,

175
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,880
parents are like pulling their children

176
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,340
close,

177
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,400
look away.

178
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,020
And I'm so worn out at this point in my

179
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,240
life. I look at her and I actually say, it

180
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,420
was a fricking spiritual awakening.

181
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,460
And she looks back and does this.

182
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,060
I know.

183
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,360
And she said,

184
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,560
we watched your Ted talk in my book club.

185
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,800
Then we read your book and we renamed

186
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,580
ourselves the breakdown babes.

187
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,440
And she said, our tagline is, we're

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,960
falling apart and it feels fantastic.

189
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,260
You can only imagine what it's like for me

190
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,140
in a faculty meeting.

191
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,920
So when I became vulnerability Ted, like

192
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,660
an action figure,

193
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,800
like Ninja Barbie, but I'm vulnerability

194
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Ted,

195
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,060
I thought I'm going to leave that shame

196
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,280
stuff behind because I spent six years

197
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,700
studying shame before I really started

198
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,100
writing and talking about vulnerability.

199
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
And I thought, thank God, because shame is

200
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,620
this horrible topic,

201
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,660
no one wants to talk about it. It's the

202
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,080
best way to shut people down on an

203
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,280
airplane.

204
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,500
What do you do? I study shame. Oh, and I

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,100
see you.

206
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,980
But in surviving this last year,

207
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,920
I was reminded of a cardinal rule,

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,420
not a research rule,

209
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,560
but a moral imperative from my upbringing.

210
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,340
You got to dance with the one who brought

211
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,520
you.

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,760
And I did not learn about vulnerability

213
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,700
and courage and creativity and innovation

214
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,040
from studying vulnerability.

215
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,160
I learned about these things from studying

216
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,540
shame.

217
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,680
And so I want to walk you in to shame.

218
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,440
Union analysts call shame the swamp land

219
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,040
of the soul.

220
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,440
And we're going to walk in. And the

221
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,680
purpose is not to walk in and, you know,

222
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,360
construct a home and live there.

223
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,680
It is to put on some galoshes and walk

224
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
through and find our way around.

225
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,100
Here's why.

226
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,060
We heard the most compelling call ever to

227
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,280
have a conversation in this country

228
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,340
and I think globally around race, right?

229
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,580
Yes, we heard that.

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,340
Yes.

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,260
Cannot have that conversation without

232
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,600
shame.

233
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,900
Because you cannot talk about race without

234
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,060
talking about privilege and when people

235
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,860
start talking about privilege, they get

236
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,740
paralyzed by shame.

237
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,920
We heard a brilliant simple solution to

238
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,540
not killing people in surgery, which is

239
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,060
have a checklist.

240
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
You can't fix that problem without

241
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,120
addressing shame because when they teach

242
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,260
those folks how to suture,

243
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,380
they also teach them how to stitch their

244
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,920
self-worth to being all -powerful.

245
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,280
And all -powerful folks don't need

246
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,260
checklists.

247
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,460
And I had to write down the name of this

248
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,240
Ted Fellow, so I didn't mess it up here.

249
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Michigan Ingo ale.

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
I hope I did right by you.

251
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,260
I saw the Ted Fellow my first day here and

252
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,980
he got up and he explained how he was

253
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,200
driven to create some technology to help

254
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,940
test for anemia because people were dying

255
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,800
unnecessarily.

256
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,700
And he said, I saw this need, so you know

257
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,520
what I did? I made it.

258
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,360
And everybody just burst into applause and

259
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,660
they were like, yes. And he said,

260
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,780
and it didn't work.

261
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,840
And then I made it 32 more times.

262
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,000
And then it worked.

263
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,820
You know what the big secret about Ted is?

264
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,260
I can't wait to tell people this. I guess

265
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm doing it right now.

266
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,280
This is like the failure conference.

267
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,960
No, it is.

268
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,560
You know why this place is amazing?

269
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,440
Because very few people here are afraid to

270
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,760
fail.

271
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,160
And no one that gets on the stage so far

272
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,400
that I've seen has not failed.

273
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,260
I have failed miserably

274
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,980
many times. I don't think the world

275
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,860
understands that because of shame.

276
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,660
There's a great quote that saved me this

277
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,280
past year by Theodore Roosevelt.

278
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,200
A lot of people refer to it as a man in

279
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,640
the arena. And it goes like this. It is

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,200
not the critic who counts.

281
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,800
It is not the man who sits and points out

282
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
how the doer of deeds could have done

283
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,300
things better and how he falls and

284
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,620
stumbles.

285
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,980
The credit goes to the man in the arena

286
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,040
whose face is marred with dust and blood

287
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,320
and sweat.

288
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,860
But when he's in the arena at best, he

289
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,280
wins.

290
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,040
And at worst, he loses.

291
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,520
But when he fails, when he loses,

292
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,380
he does so daring greatly.

293
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,160
And that's what this conference to me is

294
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,440
about.

295
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,920
That's what life is about, about daring

296
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
greatly, about being in the arena.

297
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,680
When you walk up to that arena and you put

298
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,300
your hand on the door and you think I'm

299
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,920
going in and I'm going to try this,

300
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,520
shame is the gremlin who says,

301
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,480
uh -uh,

302
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,020
you're not good enough.

303
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,960
You never finished that MBA.

304
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,640
Your wife left you.

305
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,520
I know your dad really wasn't in

306
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,900
Luxembourg. He was in Sing.

307
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
I know those things that happen to you

308
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,240
growing up.

309
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,740
I know you don't think that you're pretty

310
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,320
enough or smart enough or talented enough

311
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
or powerful enough.

312
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,440
I know your dad never paid attention even

313
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,360
when you made CFO.

314
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,240
Shame is that thing.

315
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,020
And then if we can quiet it down and walk

316
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,720
in and say, I'm going to do this,

317
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,080
we look up and the critic that we see

318
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
pointing and laughing,

319
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,460
99 % of the time is who?

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Us.

321
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,020
Shame drives two big tapes, never good

322
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,280
enough.

323
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
And if you can talk it out of that one,

324
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
who do you think you are?

325
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,120
The thing to understand about shame is

326
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,760
it's not guilt.

327
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,460
Shame is a focus on self. Guilt is a focus

328
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,940
on behavior.

329
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,700
Shame is I am bad. Guilt is I did

330
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,300
something bad.

331
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,720
How many of you, if you did something that

332
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,400
was hurtful to me, would be willing to

333
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,920
say, I'm sorry, I made a mistake?

334
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,620
How many of you would be willing to say

335
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:20,860
that?

336
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,340
Guilt,

337
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

338
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,140
Shame,

339
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,560
I'm sorry, I am a mistake.

340
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,560
There is a huge difference between shame

341
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,260
and guilt. And here's what you need to

342
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,480
know.

343
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,940
Shame is highly, highly correlated with

344
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
addiction, depression,

345
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,560
violence, aggression,

346
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,440
bullying,

347
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,260
suicide,

348
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,420
eating disorders.

349
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,220
And here's what you need to know more.

350
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,440
Guilt,

351
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
inversely correlated with those things.

352
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,520
The ability to hold something we've done

353
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,540
or failed to do up against who we want to

354
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,380
be is incredibly adaptive.

355
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,580
It's uncomfortable,

356
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,780
but it's adaptive.

357
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,000
The other thing you need to know about

358
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,960
shame is it's absolutely organized by

359
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,220
gender.

360
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,560
If shame washes over me and washes over

361
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,900
Chris,

362
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,640
it's going to feel the same.

363
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,340
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm

364
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,040
wash of shame.

365
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,460
We're pretty sure that the only people who

366
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,280
don't experience shame are people who have

367
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,980
no capacity for connection or empathy.

368
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,160
Which means, yes, I have a little shame,

369
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,280
no, I'm a sociopath,

370
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,700
so I would opt for, yes, you have a little

371
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:28,980
shame.

372
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,620
Shame feels the same for men and women,

373
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,080
but it's organized by gender.

374
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,000
For women,

375
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,580
the best example I can give you is Anjali,

376
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:41,860
who

377
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,040
is the commercial.

378
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
I can put the wash on the line, pack the

379
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
lunches, hand out the kisses and be work

380
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,340
at five to nine.

381
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in

382
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,880
the pan, and never let you forget you're a

383
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,040
man.

384
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,800
For women, shame is do it all, do it

385
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,880
perfectly, and never let them see you

386
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,040
sweat.

387
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't know how much perfume that

388
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,580
commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it

389
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,880
moved a lot of anti -depressants and anti

390
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,840
-anxiety meds.

391
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,700
Shame for women is this web of

392
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,480
unattainable,

393
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,720
conflicting, competing expectations about

394
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,780
who we're supposed to be.

395
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,900
And it's a straight jacket.

396
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,220
For men, shame is not a bunch of

397
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,800
competing, conflicting expectations.

398
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,580
Shame is one.

399
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,860
Do not be perceived as what?

400
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,880
Weak.

401
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,160
I did not interview men for the first four

402
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,660
years of my study, and it wasn't until a

403
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,760
man looked at me one day after a book

404
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,080
signing and said, I love what you have to

405
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,760
say about shame.

406
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm curious why you didn't mention men,

407
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,520
and I said, I don't study men.

408
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,920
And he said, that's convenient.

409
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,780
And I said, why? And he said, because you

410
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,520
say to reach out, tell our story,

411
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,760
be vulnerable.

412
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,060
But you see those books you just signed

413
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,300
for my wife and my three daughters?

414
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,980
I said, yeah.

415
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,340
They'd rather me die on top of my white

416
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,580
horse than watch me fall down.

417
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,020
When we reach out and be vulnerable,

418
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
we get the shit beat out of us.

419
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,820
And don't tell me it's from the guys and

420
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,860
the coaches and the dads.

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,780
Because the women in my life are harder on

422
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,520
me than anyone else.

423
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,500
So I started interviewing men and asking

424
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,060
questions.

425
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,560
And what I learned is this.

426
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
You show me a woman who can actually sit

427
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,540
with a man in real vulnerability and fear.

428
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll show you a woman who's done

429
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,460
incredible work.

430
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,580
You show me a man who can sit with a woman

431
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,160
who's just had it. She can't do it all

432
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,640
anymore.

433
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,220
And his first response is not, I unloaded

434
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,920
the dishwasher.

435
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,120
But he really listens.

436
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
Because that's all we need.

437
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,660
I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of

438
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:05,880
work.

439
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,800
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

440
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
And to get out from underneath it.

441
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,440
To find our way back to each other, we

442
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
have to understand how it affects us and

443
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,540
how it affects the way we're parenting,

444
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,100
the way we're working, the way we're

445
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,960
looking at each other.

446
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,060
Very quickly, some research by Mahler at

447
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,820
Boston College.

448
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,620
He asked, what do women need to do to

449
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,680
conform to female norms? The top answers

450
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,820
in this country?

451
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,040
Nice, thin, modest and use all available

452
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
resources for parents.

453
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,120
When they asked about men, what do men in

454
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,320
this country need to do to conform with

455
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,060
male norms? The answers were,

456
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,220
always show emotional control,

457
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,580
work as first,

458
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,220
pursue status,

459
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,360
and violence.

460
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,060
If we're going to find our way back to

461
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,800
each other, we have to understand and know

462
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,620
empathy. Because empathy is the antidote

463
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,020
to shame.

464
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,680
If you put shame in a Petra dish,

465
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,480
it needs three things to grow

466
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,980
exponentially.

467
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,020
Secrecy, silence, and judgment.

468
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
If you put the same amount of shame in a

469
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
Petra dish and douse it with empathy, it

470
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,640
can't survive.

471
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,020
The two most powerful words when we're in

472
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,460
struggle,

473
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,540
me too.

474
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,960
And so I'll leave you with this thought.

475
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,880
If we're going to find our way back to

476
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,340
each other,

477
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,020
vulnerability is going to be that path.

478
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,540
And I know it's seductive to stand outside

479
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,060
the arena because I think I did it my

480
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,460
whole life. And thanks to myself, I'm going

481
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,300
to go in there and kick some ass when I'm

482
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,840
bulletproof and when I'm perfect.

483
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,660
And that is seductive. But the truth is,

484
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,100
that never happens.

485
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
And even if you got as perfect as you

486
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,320
could in as bulletproof as you could

487
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,880
possibly muster when you got in there,

488
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,240
that's not what we want to see.

489
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,320
We want you to go in.

490
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,860
We want to be with you and across from

491
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,080
you.

492
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,240
And we just want for ourselves and the

493
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
people we care about and the people we

494
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,180
work with to dare greatly.

495
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
So thank y 'all very much. I really

496
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,880
appreciate it.

497
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,400
Thank you.

498
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,580
You
